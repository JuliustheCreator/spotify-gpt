If it has late night live jazz, that's a huge bonus. We'll be in Manhattan for only a few days late in April. \n\nSo far the only recommendation I've gotten is Arthur's Tavern. Smalls has also been recommended to me but, from what I understand, you need to make reservations and stay for the entire show - it isn't a come and go club."

I'm a huge fan of electric organs and I really like it in this, especially in lieu of brass (though I wouldn't be opposed to brass+organ)\n\n- The guitar has a super cool sound too, I can't quite describe it but it sounds almost kinda blues-ey? It sounds especially good playing those long, soft notes on the more down tempo tracks\n\n- The 'lounge'/chill vibe a lot of these tracks have are super nice, especially with the drummer using those brushes on the snare\n\nLet me know what I should check out!"

Obviously getting an 18-piece band together is no small feat, logistically or financially, and it has gotten me thinking... with modern tech, isn't there some way to have a single horn simulate those harmonized sax arrangements from back in the day? (This would be for live music.)\n\nI was thinking either an electronic saxophone, or some sort of plugin or software tool at the mixer side, or... I'm not sure!\n\nThe idea just has me captivated. A sustained melody is being played with harmonies, right? Well I know they have certain speakers that can turn on harmonies for the guitar or vocals that are plugged in, so I'm wondering if anything like this can be done for sax.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I'm not looking to simulate the \\*entire\\* horn section, just that sweet multi-sax part.\n\nThank you so much all!"

The album literally opens with him saying \"back from the dead\", so his presence is felt throughout the whole thing.\n\nHe never left. The work was complete, some songs were almost included in the previous double-album (Underground Kingz) and the production made mostly by one of his proteg√©s, Steve Below, with Cory Mo and Averexx, makes this hour long album the epitome of country rap tunes.\n\nThere isn't a song I skip. There's not a line I don't like. I can sing the whole thing, I memorized the intro and the outro.\n\nTo me this is just perfect, and there's not much else I can say to praise it. \n\n**Long live the Pimp!**\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.

Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey.\n\nThis disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited.\n\nThe trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to [\"Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour.\n\nFans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active.\n\nThere's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend."

Really loved both Shaboozey features and I‚Äôll deffo deep dive into their discography even more. DAUGHTERS, SPAGHETTI, TYRANT and SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN‚Äô were my instant favorites. Her vocals are some of the best on this record. The vocals on DAUGHTERS alone send me into tears at every listen. Can‚Äôt wait to see what Easter eggs and references people will dig up that are still hidden. I think this trilogy will be her magnum opus when it‚Äôs all done. She‚Äôs really outdone herself so far. \n\nTrack list:\n\n1. Ameriican Requiem\n2. Blackbiird (featuring Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy and Reyna Roberts)\n3. 16 Carriages\n4.

When I compare it to her earlier albums, it falls short in terms of depth and impact. But let's be real, it's Beyonc√©, so it's bound to sell well regardless of the music's quality.That said, there were a few tracks that caught my ear:  \n1. Bodyguard,\"  \n2. River Dance,\" \"  \n3. yaya  \n4. Tyrant,\" = hated how the stack the beat too much \"  \n5. 11 Most Wanted\" stood out, with Miley's killer performance  and if not for her I don‚Äôt think I would have cared?  \nOn the flip side, \"Jollies\" left me cold; it felt like a pale imitation of Dolly Parton's style and I loved that she flipped it with a warning , however I wasn‚Äôt moved cause the lyrics pissed me off cause  NO one wants her man, ü§£ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è any one who wants jay z  want him for money and affiliation not cause they love or desire him, only she can love him no shade .  \nAnyways  Out of the 27 songs on the album, only five was just ok or executed better  nothing outstanding like a halo, or love on top, or single lady‚Äôs , just bland and boring. The rest just didn‚Äôt do it for me; they didn‚Äôt give me that spine-tingling feeling or get me pumped up.  \nbut since it‚Äôs Beyonc√©  and Beyonc√©'s got a massive fanbase,her name alone can sell albums. I can't help but reminisce about the days when artists created music that spoke to everyone. Take \"Road Less Traveled\" by Lauren Alaina, \"Rock Star\" by Nickelback, or  \"Play It Again\" by Taylor Swift, for example. I‚Äôm not even a country fan, but those songs moved me to check out the genre and I don‚Äôt know them,  They didn‚Äôt rely on their names to make an impact.  \nSpeaking of names, if someone like K. Michelle dropped an album like \"Cowboy Carter,\" it probably wouldn‚Äôt make much noise and it will be criticized That just goes to show that the buzz around this album isn‚Äôt necessarily because it‚Äôs amazing; it‚Äôs more about Beyonc√©'s star power. In the end, I'd give \"Cowboy Carter\" a 4.5/10. It just didn‚Äôt click with me on a deeper level. It felt like Beyonc√© was trying too prove herself , rather than letting the music flow naturally And she is aware of that because she knows people love her they will buy it.  It‚Äôs like selling am ordinary bottle of water and then  slap Beyonc√©s name on it  and all of a sudden people call its praised like the fountain of youth  when it‚Äôs just ordinary water.  \nRenaissance which wasn‚Äôt her best has better hits  and theme aka \"uncle Jonny \"  \nlemonade  \nself entitled  \nbday  \n4  \ndangerously   in love  \nall  5 are better and stronger than her recent and if anyone where to create such a piece it would be praised the same, renaissance  grew on me on the second listen and her performance of the album was spectacular but cbc , am sorry it‚Äôs a no and the execution didnt move me  but I am sure a lot will love it cause it‚Äôs Beyonc√© but for me it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs Beyonc√© I expected more , however I respect it and glad that people love it , hopefully act 3 is better Please tell me what u think "

            "selftext": "To my mind, the instinctive approach is just \"vibing with the music\". You listen to it and you like it or not without even really knowing or attempting to know why. Maybe it's just the right situation, it hits the right emotional key, you really dig the groove, it gets you dancing... But the actual reason why you like the music (or not) is just kinda ineffable.\n\nThe analytical approach, for me, is more about looking at what the artist was trying to do and if they succeeded at it. If they're pushing the boundaries of their genre or at least their own work. Judging how inventive, smart, playful, intricate... the music is. Regardless of if I'm emotionally enjoying the music or not.\n\nThe reason why I'm asking this question is because there seems to be so much music out there that is considered great by whatever group of people that form the critical mass in our society that decides these things, but that I feel like I \"don't get\". Approaching such music with an analytical mindset and trying to look for answers for why this music is so highly valued helps me appreciate it more and I even end up liking some of it eventually. But at the end of the day, I just like what I like, no matter what some critics say. On the other hand, approaching music without attempting to examine it closely usually is more likely to lead me to stuff that I know I will like, but it makes me feel a little stagnant and unstimulated intellectually. I think it's nice to push yourself out of your comfort zone every once in a while.\n\nWhat about you? Do you just listen to music that you instinctively like or do you like to analyze it and value it based on that?"

They looked at  lyrics descriptors, including lyrical complexity, structure, emotion, and popularity.\n\nSome interesting findings:\n\n* Rock music listeners prefer older lyrics\n* Country music listeners prefer newer lyrics\n* More songs are simply repeating the same line over and over again, in all genres studied\n* Lyrics across all genre were shown to be more ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù overall\n* Lyrics have become angrier across all genres, with rap showing the most profound increase in anger\n* The amount of negative emotions conveyed also increases across all genres. Again rap shows the highest increase\n\nInteresting to consider whether this means that more personal music has become more popular over time, or whether artists have become more open and vulnerable. The repetitiveness thing makes sense, and is probably a result of our collectively shortening attention spans."

            "selftext": "I think for those of us who grew up not liking country music, sometimes if a song is good it can make it seem less like country, because we don't normally associate country with good songs.\n\nFor example did you think before that Long May You Run was a country song? Shouldn't songs with that subject matter and sound be what the genre is for? Maybe the feeling we get listening to it or Take Me Home Country Road is just what country fans feel all the time?\n\nI brought up the example of Ryan Adams a while back of someone who I never thought as a country artist but if you listen to an album like Heartbreaker or Firecracker you can argue that's my ideal version of a modern country album. I was also thinking about Sheryl Crow since I really like her new album and is overall one of my favorite female artists of all time, she went on to experiment with country in 2010s, but maybe she was always country and the biggest differentiator was songwriting talent compared to some of the generic CMT balladeers of her generation. Then when she went down country direction in last 10-15 years, it was just trying non-pop country instead of pop country like some of her 90s hits. We thought Shania was pop country but maybe she was more country than pop, and All I Wanna Do is actually what true pop country to the level that Green Day is pop punk sounds like.\n\nOr maybe the answer is somewhere in the middle."

I consider myself to be a fan of music trivia and I also enjoy looking at data.\n\nBecause it was readily accessible, I started looking into the duration of songs. At first I thought hey, let's find out what did the beatles think about the ideal length of a song. I quite quickly found out that, before sgt pepper, all their songs lasted between 2-3 minutes, and after that their song durations are all over the place.\n\nThen i thought I'd look at a broader list, and decided to find out how long did the [Billboard 100 songs for each year](https://twitter.com/diegost/status/1774191119154188369) go for. In there, it's clear that up until the 80's, song durations were clearly increasing, averaging 2 and a half minutes in the early 60's and peaking at almost 4 and a half during the middle 80's.\n\nAfter that, popular songs started getting shorter. Way shorter. To the point where the average song duration is close to that of 1975.\n\nSo I started thinking, what made people prefer shorter songs? Was it MTV? Well after the release of the first MTV video, popular songs still got a bit longer for a couple years until they stopped.\nSo was it the relase of the CD? Well that was 1984/5 ish. Which could be an explanation, but then, the shortening never stopped. It didn't stop by the time p2p and torrents came out, and still songs being featured as the most popular are, on average, still getting shorter\n\nSo I just wanted to ask all of you, what do you think drives the overall perception of how long popular songs should be? was it tech? was it a specific band or artist? Is there a limit?"

Beyonce is making her own twist on country with Cowboy Carter and yes this will rile some people up. Country fans especially have very strict views on what constitutes as country music with some usually underlying racist undertones going into those perceptions of \"what country really is.\"\n\n Most mainstream listeners also don't like country music so of course this album is dividing some fans. When listening to this album you need to understand that it is not trying to be a purely country record. It's Beyonce's version of country, rock, blues, and R & B. If you can't accept that as a concept the record won't sit well with you. I actually found it very enjoyable to listen to and love how she created a story with the interludes and storytelling is a big element of country music. Just felt like putting this out there. I'm someone who really likes it when artists play around with genres (big fan of Jewel for instance) but if you're someone whose looking for an album to fit into one genre or another this will feel like a mess."

Obviously there's great artists on both sides of the pond but the emphasis is different for various reasons.\n\nSo this naturally brought me to the topic of British solo artists and their influence. When I look at some of them, there's certainly some massive impact.\n\nWhen it comes to this topic, David Bowie casts a massive shadow. One of the most influential artists in general, and especially for the UK. Many artists cited his performance on Top Of The Pops as Ziggy as a huge inspiration for them to start music. And he became a major leader for music from that point forward, presaging many musical trends over the decades.\n\nOther artists that came to mind for this topic: Brian Eno, Elton John, Kate Bush, Elvis Costello, Cliff Richard, Van Morrison...\n\nMy general observation is that certain British solo artists tend to be more well-known in their native UK or more appreciated by music fans and artists. Whereas the British bands loom quite large. Of course, I would also want to hear from UK commenters on who they consider the most impactful British solo artists.\n\n**Overall questions:**\n\n* Who would you consider the most influential British solo artists (other than Bowie)?\n* What do you notice about British solo artists as compared to British bands?

The Smashing Pumpkins changed the color profile of the cover of *Siamese Dream* in 2011 and made it much worse. There doesn't seem to be any aesthetic reasoning behind the change.\n\nSimilarly, I'm mystified by Phil Collins's decision to reshoot the close up photos on his album sleeves as a much older man. He didn't *make* these albums as a much older man, this isn't a Taylor's Version scenario going on here, it's the same albums from the 80s.

I listen to lots of music and watch lots of movies in terms of looking at art I have a poor eye. \n\nLots of us know Bill Withers from his songs that are so ingrained in music culture such as 'Aint No Sunshine' 'Lean On Me' 'Lovely Day' and 'Just The Two of Us'.

Nothing seems like it is too much it always feels like a certain instrument was brought in right on time to give the song the extra kick. The listener didn't know we needed it but it's there and it is perfect. The lyrics tell relatable stories I feel like in 'Harlem' he could be writing about my town in Ireland as he describes good folks getting up and out and about at 6am while others are only getting home from the party. \n\nThis is my first post but go easy on me.

And while their music is outside of my favored tastes, it's great new wave stuff!  Their sound and style is really interesting stuff to listen to in contrast to stuff that's released nowadays.  New Sensation still hits hard these days.However, I grew up in a small town, so I only heard their stuff once or twice on the radio, but I heard INXS and their song New Sensation about a billion times as part of mid-'90s car and truck commercials.  Stuff like this: [1995 Toyota-thon commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_AEKO5xGI)\n\nI tried to find the specific commercial I had in mind, but it could've been a regional thing.  The point is that a strong imprint was made at the time, and well, I kinda find it unfortunate that when I hear New Sensation, I associate it as part of a Toyota Sales Event.\n\nOf course, INXS has the right to commercialize their music, and I think the world benefited from that, but it makes me realize how much of a role context plays in the listening experience.  As a big Aphex Twin fan, it makes me appreciate that he's tended to minimize his commercialization as his stardom has developed, for instance.I think it's interesting how direct an artist can be with their listeners nowadays, and also to consider the machinations of commercial culture and the kind of circumstances it can create in people with regards to good music that is successfully commercialized.\n\nI guess I find some valuation from bands or artists that stay away from commercializing, or are at least smart about it.  But then, as the artist, if you pass up the money, it just goes to someone else, right?  Perhaps this is why I am really excited by music nowadays, since I can forge that connection to the music directly.\n\nBut also, I suppose it's worth considering how often people in the world get exposure to music outside of commercialized situations these days.  My guess is that most music, disregarding folk music, is connected to a commercialized product nowadays.  I supposed in the end, all culture is commercial, anyway, right?  I guess this is where I end up--a consequence of an unfortunate commercialization of good music."

That also shouldn't be surprising when one thinks about the amount of resources (material and otherwise) that Beyonce leverages, as well as her natural talent as an artist.\n\nBeyonce has been in the stage of her career for the last few years where she's achieved much of what she's wanted ‚Äî more money than a person could spend in a lifetime, widespread critical acclaim in the popular music press, adoring fans in any major city. At this point, she can seek to make \"riskier\" albums, ones that show off more artistry and where every song doesn't have to have hit single potential. It is interesting to investigate how she uses this new-found freedom.\n\nCowboy Carter's immediate best quality is its production. Lots of double-tracked vocals and choruses and intricate rhythm sections that draw from hip hop. The studio has been used wonderfully as an instrument, adding a lot to an album that has a lot of good musical concepts.\n\nHowever, where this album falls short is its raison d'etre, its reason for existence. While this sound is lovely, when I listened to a song like Tyrant, I was reminded of indie artists like Samoht who explored a lot of this on his 2019 album Exit (listen to Yellow Diamonds for maximum effect) in a way that feels more committed to country as a genre (and more interesting). It feels that, on a song like Sweet Honey Buckiin', she gets bored of country and jumps to other genres, just leaning on country tropes to get through the song. Whereas an album like the Byrds' shocking 1968 country album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, was genuinely risky for a band like them who traded in their good name as popular innovators in folk-rock and psychedelic rock to make a subversive country pastiche despised by the Nashville establishment, Beyonce bares little risk here. We know that she's in her moment of shopping around genres she once overlooked, and the disappointed Beyonce fan can rest easy knowing that her chaps and cowboy boots will be retired in due time. Especially at a time that country dominates the charts, one can't help but view Beyonce adopting the country aesthetic as a sign of the times. Even a pop artist as talented as her isn't immune to market pressures, and when you reach Beyonce's level of fame (and intend to keep it), it's in your best interest to evolve as consumer tastes change.\n\nUltimately, this is a solid album and many of the songs merit repeated listens. I can't help but feel that there was potential missing in the album. While there are hints to Beyonce's concern about systemic problems like racism and poverty in America, she only offers brief liberal acknowledgements of the harm, like on Ya Ya. If you look away for a moment, you're bound to miss it and you're whisked away to dance during the refrain and chorus. I don't expect musicians to be political scientists or theorists, but when I think of Black Americana artists like Yola, who made a lovely critique of economic inequality on the 2021 song Diamond Studded Shoes, it's clear that many musicians in this tradition are able to offer thoughtful criticism of the world around us as it is and articulate a more just alternative. Rather than this album and its contents being born of necessity, curiosity, experimentation, or as a challenge, it feels like it comes out of expediency. *Now's a great time to make a country album, so why shouldn't Beyonce join in?*"

I just feel like it kinda leads nowhere when it comes to developing taste. People buy this, and then they rarely ever buy stuff which directly evolved from it, like Suicide, Swans, Sonic Youth etc.   \n\n\nWhat makes it so popular then? Is it solely because of the cover? Do people really like the cover and the pop songs on it so much they are willing to drop 30 bucks on it?"

I‚Äôm not sure why but I don‚Äôt feel that as much with other intense songs, like the ones by Iron and wine, or Saintseneca. \n\nSecondly, his female worship is a little too much sometimes. I‚Äôm a straight guy and although I kinda feel like that sometimes, I‚Äôm not a big fan of his descriptions of his relationships with women. It‚Äôs all very intense and very imposingly masculine in a progressive way, sure, but imagine if a female artist worships men that way in her songs. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be labeled something bad. All in all, I want to know how others think about his music. Men, tell me if you see what I‚Äôm talking about, and women, tell me what you feel listening to this man.

There were of course innovations that happened outside the classical tradition, in particular in jazz, rock, rap and electronic music that would be hard to ignore.   \nOn the other hand, rock, rap and electronic seem almost too trivial compared to the state-of-the-art in classical music.  \nRock was at the complexity level of R&B and folk music in the 60s while the classical tradition was in the wildest avant-garde phase at the time.   \nYou could argue that rock music, rap and electronic did catch up in sophistication over time, but of course only within the boundaries of trivial, popular music.   \nSo it's a sort of anachronism that happened in Western music which would make it strange to put something like The Beatles in the same list as Beethoven.\n\nWhat do you think?"

These environments allowed people to have a micro-culture that is divorced, independent and ahead of the larger culture, allowing them to spearhead new stiyles of music and art.\n\nThese places have been systematically destroyed and those communities dispersed into undesirable and remote areas.\n\nI fear that with the destruction of these communities that gave us music like jazz and hip hop and rock and roll we are going to miss out on a lot of new styles of music that could have been and now never will see the light of day.\n\nI feel that gentrification is a sort of cultural destruction similar to book burnings of the nazis.\n\nI'd like to read your thoughts on this."

Please understand that I don't mean this in a derogatory sense, but this is just how I would describe this vocal style. It seems particularly more common in a alot of post-90s post-hardcore music. I think the progenitor of this vocal style is probably Geddy Lee from Rush. His vocals on their early albums are shrill in a way I think was unlike any vocals in a rock band at the time. But I am curious if there were any other vocalists that came up between that time and the time of the other artists I just mentioned that helped to normalize that style. Maybe some really obscure bands. Do you know of any others?\n\n\n\n\n"

I want to discuss ways in which musicians in different genres use other people's music. Specifically when something is borrowed explicitly and significantly, not just being strongly influenced by something.\n\nIn rock and pop music, the most prevalent usage of others' music is by doing covers. Covers can either be as identical to the original as possible or be so different that it might only share words with the original.\n\nIn jazz they play standards. They'll keep the same chord progressions and melody but improvise solos. (simplifying of course)\n\nIn EDM, there's remixes, where one artist will just make their own version of another song in a new style.\n\nTo me, these are all basically the same idea: one artist reworking another artist's work in their own way - as close or far from the original as they care to be. The differences are interesting though. Jazz standards are more or less the origin of jazz itself. Only over time did it become more and more common to write and release your own jazz compositions. You could make a similar argument for rock, as it came from blues, but to me feels more separate from that origin. Nowadays, rock covers are mostly a novelty. EDM remixes on the other hand are essential, and there are many noteworthy artists (mostly DJs) that have nary a fully original track!\n\nHow do you see things? Are there other interesting similarities/differences?\n\n--\n\nOther examples of borrowing music:\n\n- rap music using samples, specifically not sampling other rap music\n\n- any of the many sample-based genres, like plunderphonics\n\n- traditional folk music is all \"covers\" in a sense\n\n- another jazz example is \"quoting\" one song while playing another\n\nI'm very curious to hear more examples as I'm sure there are some really cool ones out there."

In my opinion at first let‚Äôs look at industrial and rock genres.  Noise is a common element for both. Industrial took influences from various avant garde influences and made them extreme and dark as well as taking from electronic music . Early Industrial like throbbing gristle have full on noise tracks as well. Industrial  tends to use noise to create weird and eerie sounds focusing on soundscapes. Distortion and noise is a basic element for rock music as well (espescially its harder styles like metal and punk) and the more extreme and heavy it gets the noisier it gets. Rock tends to use these elements in a more straight forward/in your face manner. Japanoise bands like merzbow really have that rock n roll philosophy and try to assault you with as much distortion ,loudness and feedback possible. Noise is the logical conclusion of both genres. As we look even further though I think this would apply to the rest of the genres under the ‚Äúextreme‚Äùmusic umbrella . All the gabber/hardcore techno genres, some free jazz, some other post industrial genres, and the rest of the extreme avant genres (basically free improv and a lot of avant/modern classical stuff like Iannis Xenakis.) Basically it seems at first that the more extreme music gets the closer to noise it gets right? \n\n"

Seether's Fake It is a bop. Shinedown's \"Save Me\" has an absolutely beautiful performance from the lead singer that transcends the song, 3 Doors Down's \"Kryptonite\" has the stupidest premise possible but gets me every time because of the melody and dynamics, and Hoobastank is one of my guilty pleasures (\"Out of Control\" is simply fun, and \"Running Away\" was one of my early introductions into experimenting with rhythm).\n\nMy thesis is that if the social environment was different, these artists would be regarded much more highly than they are now.

Bey is no stranger to this, with Renaissance of course being house and Lemonade also drew on many genres, as well as The Gift being a venture into afrobeats. \n\nMany other artists throughout the years have also taken on and experimented with new genres that drift away from the genre they are known for, with some of these being more successful than others. Miley comes to mind for me, having tackled hip-hop, country and rock albums. Gaga has also taken on country and EDM for her albums, with rumors that LG7 is going to be rock. Experimenting with different genres really does feel like a distinction between artists who really care about progressing their work and those who don‚Äôt. \n\nWith this in mind, are there any artists who you think could make a great body of work with experimentation of a different genre to their usual? \n\nI actually think The Weeknd could make a pretty great album with rock influences. He has already ventured from the trap-R&B sound that he started with, with the synth-pop new-wave sounds of After Hours and Dawn FM. I‚Äôd love to see what he could do with an album that incorporates rock and some blues inspiration. He did experiment with some punk-type influences on his Thursday mixtape.  \n\nI know people feel like the disco trend has been a bit overdone now, but I would love to hear a disco and funk album from Ariana Grande. I feel like she would do a really good job with it, and would establish her as an artist who isn‚Äôt afraid of taking sonic risks because a lot of people do see her as sticking to the same sound. I feel like ‚Äúbye‚Äù from eternal sunshine was just a flavor of what this could sound like!\n\nMight sound like a bit of an odd one, but I would love to hear Dua Lipa make a soul album with jazz and R&B influences.

There are no credits printed anywhere. In fact, the pysical copies are pretty bare bones of any visual and textual content. I've never seen an artist release an album and keep their credits a secret.

            "selftext": "It's no secret that physical media has become increasingly lucrative for modern pop artists, but at what cost does that come to fans? On one hand, it's meant that vinyl releases from the last few years have often been much less bare-bones than they have been for other modern pop records, but it's also meant that a lot of releases have been rushed and/or incomplete. \n\nSome examples of recent controversies regarding physical releases:\n- Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday 2 having only 8 of 22 tracks on physical media \n- Beyonc√©'s Cowboy Carter having an entirely different concept (including the title, cover, and general art direction) on physical media, including the omission of 5 tracks\n- Lorde's Solar Power, Charli XCX's Crash and Ariana Grande's Eternal Sunshine all including demo/unfinished versions of some songs\n- Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department and Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS having a different exclusive track depending on which vinyl variant was bought\n- Taylor Swift's Midnights CD's having a baffling array of different tracklists that makes it impossible to find a comprehensive version\n- Barbie The Album having different tracks omitted between releases\n- Bj√∂rk's Fossora having completely different versions of multiple tracks, including missing features, as well as an unfinished cover art\n- Caroline Polachek's Desire, I Want To Turn Into You being delayed on vinyl on multiple occasions due to having a release date that was never realistic given vinyl production times\n \nI just thought it'd be interesting to have a discussion. Do you like physical media? Are you willing to sacrifice a complete or well-packaged release to ensure it's available upon release, or would you rather wait? In what ratio do you care about content (tracklists, audio quality) versus marketing (colour, collectability, packaging)? What makes you buy or not buy a piece of physical media?"

The album was certified triple platinum by Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThe album‚Äôs blend of Soul singing and melodies with Boom Bap Hip-Hop production was hugely influential and laid the foundation for the Hip-Hop Soul genre.\n\nGenres: Hip-Hop Soul, New Jack Swing.\n\nI‚Äôve been wanting to do this album for awhile now but didn‚Äôt know when the right time was. But for some reason it wasn‚Äôt until this week it felt like the right time to finally cover this album. R&B was in a bit of a transitional period between 1993 and 1995. New Jack Swing was on it‚Äôs way out and R&B was branching out into other styles. One of these is the Hip-Hop Soul genre which this album helped start. The genre directly evolved from New Jack Swing and it‚Äôs kinda obvious since you can still hear a decent amount of New Jack production elements from this record.\n\nOverall when we talk about great and influential front to back albums this album will always come up in the discussion. Its influence on post-90s Contemporary R&B is still seen to this day.\n\nThat said what are your thoughts on this album? Is it better than My Life?\n\n\n"

I also really like Pink Floyd‚Äôs ‚ÄòWelcome to the Machine‚Äô. Deadmau5‚Äôs ‚ÄòImaginary Friends‚Äô synth arpeggiation is sublime (but when the beats drop, it‚Äôs just doof time, which is fine but isn‚Äôt my thing).\n\nAre there modern (or old) artists who make great use of synth arps whom you could recommend a track by for me?\n\nSide question, are there more modern electronic artists who are perhaps less ‚Äòin the box‚Äô (than Deadmau5 for example whose work to me is too dry/programmy), eg doesn‚Äôt sound like a computer creation top to bottom, more into reamping, natural reverb, human tempo variations (even if they step beyond the strict definition of ‚Äòelectronic‚Äô to achieve it such as with human musicians?) I hear awesome stuff by Blanck Mass, NIN/Reznor/Ross, Barrow/Salisbury, Death Grips‚Ä¶ but sometimes I feel like there‚Äôs a jarringly claustrophobic ear-smashing ‚Äúhaving a bad time on drugs‚Äù vibe in their mixes."

            "subreddit": "electronicmusic",
            "selftext": "Years ago I made a guide to hard dance music on this very sub, I was an anxious high schooler who could barely put to words what he was listening to so needless to say that guide sucked, so I've decided to make a new one. My main goal is not to feed people a bunch of regurgitated information and talk about what I hear/notice\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: I am no music scholar nor do I agree with every single genre definition out there, I find the pigeonholing to be pretty silly sometimes. There will be holes in this list and possibly some wrong info, my only area of expertise is that I've been listening to this stuff for upwards of 10+ years. (This list will be in no particular order)\n-\n* **Early Rave**: Haaaaaakuuuuuhhhhhhhhh!!! One of the best things to come out of the Netherlands, distorted 909s, rave stabs, horror movie samples and fast tempos. Early Rave is a pretty broad definition but in this case I'm talking about Gabber. Ground zero for tons of genres that will be mentioned in this list, and still so very fun to move your feet to!\n\nExample: [Predator vs Wedlock - Get on Down](https://youtu.be/sz_smWSWfOo?si=hpmlZBAjfqAnIqG6)\n\n\nArtists: Ruffneck (and his thousands of aliases), 3 Steps Ahead, Chosen Few, Nasenbluten, Predator\n\n\nLabels: Ruffneck Records, Bloodyfist Records, Industrial Strength Records, Wax Weasel, Pengo Records, Cenobite Records    \n\n\n* **Makina**: A Spanish genre of music (with a healthy community in Japan and the UK) and also one of my favorites on this list! A sort of combination of trance and happy hardcore, sped up and given this addictively bouncy off beat bass! There are a few offshoots within the genre itself (Base Makina) but the stuff I want to talk about is the cheesy happy kind.\n\n\nExample: [Netherworld - Atlantis](https://youtu.be/hJ81wiMX0FU?si=PlLa7ZhAtBvV98pu)\n\n\nArtists: DJ Ruboy, M-Project, Xavi BCN, DJ El Brujo, PJ Makina, Pastis & Buenri, 3R2\n\n\nLabels: BIT Music, ADN Sound, Burning Chrome, DJ's At Work, UAM (Underground Amateur Music)\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Hardstyle**: At some point Gabber died and from the ashes came Hardstyle! Slower and with longer, less overdriven kick drums, it showed that faster isn't always better. Hardstyle was my starting point for Hard Dance music and I know I'm not alone. There's something for everyone in this genre and it has gone through many changes with distinct eras between each change, covering all the off shoots and era's is worthy of its own thread\n\n\nExample: [Ran-D - The Twilight Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-vw-F9lJAM)\n\n\nArtists: Technoboy, Headhunterz, Wildstylez, Da Tweekaz, Zatox, Coone, Tuneboy, Audiofreq, DJ Thera, Noisecontrollers\n\n\nLabels: Scantraxx, Dirty workz, A^2, Italian Hardstyle, Gearbox Digital, Theracords\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Happy Hardcore**: Applied to a lot of genres and styles over the years. Happy Hardcore to me is pitched up vocals, breakbeats and sickeningly sweet melodies that grew alongside Gabber. A lot of Happy Hardcore producers would go onto produce what we know as UK Hardcore today. Happy Hardcore emerged around the same time as Eurodance so some of the parallels are unsurprising.\n\n\nExample: [DJ Trixxy & DJ Brisk - Eyeopener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81QqHUpyBhg)\n\n\nArtists: Banana Man, Hixxy, Darren Styles, Scott Brown, Brisk, DJ Ham\n\n\nLabels: Blatant Beats, Evolution Records, Slammin' Vinyl, The World Of Obsession Recordings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Freeform Hardcore**: A combination of Trance and UK Hardcore with some leanings into Psytrance here and there. Deep and haunting with some flangers and phasers thrown in for good measure. I don‚Äôt have much else to say about the genre other than it can truly be an experience sometimes.\n\n\nExample: [Alek Szahala - Afternoon Owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlJ9VgmA4dI)\n\n\nArtists: Alek Szahala, Betwixt & Between, Substanced, A.B., Transcend, DJ Rx\n\n\nLabels: Nu Energy, Stamina Records, FINRG, ReBuild Music, Watchtower Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Terrorcore**: Emerged around the same time as Gabber and honestly early Terrorcore is kinda hard to distinguish from it. Terrorcore has since grown and developed into something much more distinct, I've never been able to properly describe how it's different so I'll just say it's faster and more aggressive than your average Gabber track. It has some noticeable similarities with Speedcore (vocal chops, drum patterns .etc)\n\n\nExample: [Danny Ovington - Cocaine MF (Tim Shopp Remix)](https://youtu.be/IXlAGt4s5pU?si=KbwqD6uXNV5WrFXA)\n\n\nArtists: Noisekick, The Destroyer, RedOgre, DJ Smurf, DJ Skinhead, Tense, Nevermind, Drokz, SRB, Akira\n\n\nLabels: Noisekick Records, Airfight Records, This Is Terror, GGM (Geordie Gabba Mafia), Hong Kong Violence \n\n\n\n\n* **Speedcore**: Fast as fuck boiiiii, seems to be getting more recognition in recent years due to rhythm games (I have no hard evidence to back this up) 300 BPM distorted kick drums that can range from black trench coat school shooter waiting to happen levels of edgy all the way over to clown dancing at a birthday party levels of silly, certainly not for everyone but I fucking love it (has an amazing community of producers in Japan)\n\n\nExample: [m1dy - 37 Dicks](https://youtu.be/DTnHdWA9WTE?si=7eEn2mMIO6G-v7kg)\n\n\nArtists: m1dy, Kobaryo, Komprex, Jimmy S, Quick Brown Fox, Loffciamcore, Gabba Front Berlin, DJ Freak, Lord Lloigor, Passenger of Shit\n\nLabels: SKRD!!!, Psycho Filth Records, Noistorm, United Speedcore Nation, Speedcore Worldwide, MADDEST CHICK'NDOM, Canadian Speedcore Resistance, Shitwank Records\n\n* **Extratone**: Towards the bottom of the musical Iceberg, people tend to laugh this genre off and I can see why. 1000 BPM kick drums and ear rending, abrasive soundscapes that you do not want to listen to while under the influence of anything that speeds up your heart rate. Still as a bridge between harsh noise and hardcore, I can dig it, and there are some producers who do some interesting things at such high tempos\n\nExample: [Pyrrhon - House of pain](https://youtu.be/DWuFoPVVEi4?si=vHTZgpdVJAeI7Kbo)\n\nArtists: Gridbug, Annoying Ringtone, Neocoretex, PRESSTERROR, Ralph Brown, Junkie Kut, Coakira\n\nLabels: Legs Akimbo Records, Extratone Records, SKRD!!!, Speedcore Worldwide, Splitterblast Records, Fujimi Industry Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Digital Hardcore**: Remember when Alek Empire made good music? Digital Hardcore is a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù combination of Punk Rock and Hardcore dance music that comes together as a flaming middle finger to the establishment, with one of the first acts being Atari Teenage Riot. As the years have gone on more metal influences have seeped into Digital Hardcore, widening the definition a bit but God damn there's nothing like a distorted 909 over a sick guitar tone\n\nExample: [Atari Teenage Riot - Your Uniform (Does Not Impress Me!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qLrsRhhZE)\n\nArtists: Atari Teenage Riot, Akira Death, Ozigiri, Moshpit\n\nLabels: Digital Hardcore Recordings (I don‚Äôt listen to digital hardcore enough lol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Frenchcore**: People clown on the French for various things but God damn what an amazing country for electronic music! Early Frenchcore is quite different from what it is now, mainly known for it‚Äôs current iteration with big distorted sausage kicks that are just a hair away from clipping the fuck out of your preamp. Not entirely sure why but it shares a good chunk of it's community with Hardtek so it's not uncommon to see producers do both\n\nExample: [Lenny Dee, Randy & The Sickest Squad - Boomshakalaka (2016 Rebuild)](https://youtu.be/O5Y2FcpzF44?si=GlYGTe3vt6Hv4pIg)\n\nArtists: The Sickest Squad, Radium, Adrenochrome, Le Bask, Hellfish, The Speed Freak, Dr. Peacock\n\nLabels: Peacock Records, Audiogenic, Frenchcore Worldwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Hardtek**: Associated with free parties and dudes with dreads. 190 BPM often copyright infringing goodness, has become my go to genre to spin at parties and people who've never heard it tell me how much they like it! I've never been able to really discern what separates it from ‚ÄúTribecore‚Äù but that's technically another genre (Raggatek is super similar so I'll just include it in this section)\n\nExample: [Guigoo - Just 1 Love](https://youtu.be/jRzs9VIa3Ts?si=-a-98gPY2ewhgdbU)\n\nArtists: Billx, Mat Weasel, Floxytek, Guigoo (FANT4STIK) Harry Potar, C3B, T-Menace, Dr. Looney, Tanukichi, E-Coli, Vandal, Lolistyle Gabbers, Mandidextrous, MikkiM, Loctek\n\nLabels: Undergroundtekno, Narcotek, Kaotik Soundsystem, Amen4tekno, Raggatek Power, Hardtek.jp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Breakcore**: Has seen a rise among the zoomers and Tiktok kids due to artists like Sewerslvt and Machine Girl, I'm not here to debate whether or not that's a good thing. Breakcore has it‚Äôs roots firmly in Jungle, and you can hear it in a lot of earlier iterations. Breakbeats chopped, screwed and mangled with loads of samples from any number of sources. Brutal and fast with ragga vocals, distant and moody with loads of reverb and rave sounds or goofy and dumb with pop samples and fast kick drums there's a little something for everyone here and I hope people don't stop at just Sewerslvt and Machine Girl (I like both SS and MG)\n\nExample: [Repeater - Collision Repair Specialist](https://youtu.be/4uHVSexjYCY?si=Rcxe5cLY51D8265d)\n\nArtists: Ruby My Dear, Bong-Ra, Rotator, Venetian Snares, DJ Skullvomit, Kyou1110, Ladyscraper, X√ÑCKSECKS, DJKurara, Squarepusher, Passenger of Shit, Epsilon, Goreshit\n\nLabels: Day of the Droids, Breakcore Gives Me Wood, Murder Channel, Super Bad Midi Breaks, PEACE OFF RECORDS, Shitwank Records, Bloodyfist Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Gabber**: Wait didn't we already do this one? Sort of! After OG Gabber died a new generation started, like Hardstyle this genre has gone through many different changes and is worthy of it's own thread. It's a genre I have a lot of love for and is one that would make most people's eyes go wide when I would show it to them lol. I don't like the direction Gabber has gone in recent years but I'll always have my favorite era to look back on\n\nExample: [Evil Activities - No Place To Hide](https://youtu.be/M_A9ARFw6Tg?si=mszoL0GCVSZUMhbU)\n\nArtists: Angerfist, Outblast, Art of Fighters, Neophyte, Ophidian, Andy The Core, I:Gor, Evil Activities, Unexist, Mad Dog, Stunned Guys\n\nLabels: Enzyme Records, Masters Of Hardcore, Deathchant Records, Hong Kong Violence, Dogfight Records, Industrial Strength \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **J-Core**: The older I've gotten the more I dislike this name. I can't for the life of me find this article but in it I want to say DJ Sharpnel said that J-Core was used on file sharing clients and forums to classify ANY KIND of Japanese Hardcore. To me J-Core doesn't have defining sound (like Frenchcore) and it's used very loosely to the point where it's kinda useless. Which isn't to say you shouldn't check out Japanese Hardcore artists because holy shit it was life changing for me!\n\nExample: [Anglerfish Team - Enter Enter MISSION! (DJ Sharpmarker Remix)](https://youtu.be/w_UHd6Gv7UA?si=wzIeVcYP49U5le3e)\n\nArtists: REDALiCE, t+pazolite, DJ Sharpnel, Noizenico, DJ TECHNORCH, DJ Genki, DJ Myosuke, NNN, Roughsketch, Kobaryo, DJ Noriken, P*light\n\nLabels: Shaprnel Sound, 999 Recordings, HARDCORE TANO*C, Solidbox Records, C.H.S, Japanese Stream Hardcore, Sketch-up! Recordings\n\n\n\n* **Crossbreed**: A combination of Industrial Hardcore and Drum & Bass, not gonna lie I've never heard much of the DNB influence in this creature but holy shit this stuff can knock a tooth loose. Tight snares, dirty kicks and a dark atmosphere all combine to make something so fucking awesome that even the most snooty Drum & Bass head can be swayed by it‚Äôs dark powers\n\nExample: [The Outside Agency - Prepare to Die](https://youtu.be/XnnGjBPAMkw?si=mrcTO6SPOfg1FvOY)\n\nArtists: Eye-D, DJ Hidden (The Outside Agency), Igneon System, C-Netik, Hallucinator, Switch Technique, Sinister Souls, Counterstrike, Lowroller, The Satan\n\nLabels: Genosha One Seven Five, PRSPCT Recordings, Oblivion Underground Recordings, Abused Recordingz, Future Sickness Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Hands Up**: Remember the 2000s? Remember when Hands Up could chart and be played on mainstream radio? Ahhh good times‚Ä¶ One of the softer forms of Hard Dance, I guess you could consider it pop music but boy do I sure love it and all it's bubble gum goodness, still going strong away from the limelight!\n\nExample: [Cascada - Everytime We Touch](https://youtu.be/4G6QDNC4jPs?si=AjtXN4aZ_upsIwGU)\n\nArtists: Danceboy, CLAWZ, Summertunez, The Italo Brothers, Rob Mayth, Aki, Smile dk, Vau Boy\n\nLables: Hands Up Legacy (I can‚Äôt find many labels lmaooooo)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Eurobeat**: I mean‚Ä¶ I'm sure most people know about this one. Evolved from italio disco with it's catapult to recognition being the Anime ‚ÄúInitial D‚Äù I'm not 100% sure it's Hard Dance, but lots of hard dance fans I know fuck with it so I'll put it here! A hard to describe kick sound and blaring synths trying to emulate brass with some vocals by dudes with noticable European accents! What's not to love?\n\nExample: [Smile.dk - Koko Soko (AKIBA KOUBOU Eurobeat Remix)](https://youtu.be/X7kMP24N2UI?si=mB4D60xMPiG9sNsg)\n\nArtists: Oddesy (Ken Blast), A-One, Go2, Lupin, Hot Blade, Za-Za\n\nLabels: avex (specifically the Super Eurobeat comps, I‚Äôm being a little lazy here but holy fuck there are so many that it's more than you could ever ask for)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Hard Trance**: Back when Hardstyle was new, Hard Trance and it were hard to distinguish. There are a few variations of Hard Trance but my favorite will always be Gated Kick Hard Trance. If you can imagine Hardstyle percussion mixed with Trance Melodies then you've already got a good idea of what it sounds like. Not as popular as it used to be but somehow stays alive\n\nExample: [Josh Lang - Sawtooth Highway](https://youtu.be/-Lt9JoJNHTk?si=fa-aChOOopXxjlDS)\n\nArtists: Luca Antolini, Andrea Montorsi, Splinta, Kid Kaos, Alex Kidd, Josh Lang, Log:One, Nomad, Pacific Link, Yoji Biomehanika\n\nLabels: Kiddfectious, Therabyte, K405 Records, Lashed Music, Trancefuzion Recordings, Hell‚Äôs House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **UK Hardcore**: Happy Hardcore cheese with an offbeat bass. I'm oversimplifying but that doesn't mean I dislike it! I‚Äôm willing to bet if Hardstyle wasn't your starting point then you got your start with UK Hardcore.\n\nExample: [Darren Styles - Satellite (Update)](https://youtu.be/ul8VNYm5JJE?si=yDhaHskZv-4Tusnk)\n\nArtists: Nu Foundation, Nanobii, Rythmics, Gammer, Darren Styles, Re-Con, Brisk\n\nLabels: Together We Rise (TWR), Relentless Vinyl, Next Generation Records, Lethal Theory, Nu Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n* **Schranz**: When I think rave music this is one of the first that comes to mind, a genre of Germanic origin with galloping kicks that pound on your brain. I'm not huge on Hard Techno but God damn do I love me some Schranz\n\nExample: [Julyukie - Hard Techno Junkie (Slugos Remix)](https://youtu.be/CIVE3UCW43M?si=qw7IIui8kRo5VGme)\n\nArtists: Eto & Gab, Viper XXL, Instigator, O.B.I, Slugos, Greg Notill\n\nLabels: Bitshift, Hardsignal, Pounding Grooves, Kombination Research, Skizofrenik Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* **Hard House**: To me there's two iterations of Hard House, American and UK. American Hard House had a pretty major scene on the West Coast (specifically in California), more hardcore influence with some leanings into Jumpstyle of all things. Really amazing stuff, and when you find a hard house mix CD uploaded to YouTube you can find plenty of people reminiscing about the good times had at the arena. UK Hard House is more bouncy, it kinda sounds like Makina at a slower tempo. I've heard the term ‚ÄúScouse‚Äù thrown around but have never been able to find a proper definition of it :/. I don't know as much about the history of UK Hard House but I still love it all the same!\n\nAmerican Example: [DJ Work - Hocus Pokus](https://youtu.be/F1hHNOvbmR4?si=JDUJ_8y2C6dfeoVn)\n\nUK Example: [Mark Kavanagh - Is Everybody Ready?](https://youtu.be/9v3QgYkuqpQ?si=bscIsBQKpCS2Xi1G)\n\nArtists: Tidy Boys, Darren R, George Centeno, BK, DJ Irene, Lisa Lashes, Tony De Vit, Poogie Bear, Mauro Picotto\n\nLabels: Underground Construction, Nukleuz, Tidy Trax, Jump Wax Records, Tripoli Trax"

My friend Judy Nylon had visited, and brought with her a record of 17th-century harp music. I asked her to put it on as she left, which she did, but it wasn‚Äôt until she‚Äôd gone that I realized that the hi-fi was much too quiet and one of the speakers had given up anyway.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was raining hard outside, and I could hardly hear the music above the rain ‚Äî just the loudest notes, like little crystals, sonic icebergs rising out of the storm. I couldn‚Äôt get up and change it, so I just lay there waiting for my next visitor to come and sort it out, and gradually I was seduced by this listening experience. I realized that this was what I wanted music to be ‚Äî a place, a feeling, an all-around tint to my sonic environment.‚Äù\n\nCitation: the bottom of the second page of his famous [essay](https://monoskop.org/images/3/31/Eno_Brian_1996_2004_Ambient_Music.pdf)"

I haven't danced like that in years. Both of these albums were incredibly important to my growing love of electronic music in the early 90's and it was awesome to see them perform these classics live. The crowd was great to, old heads, young heads, and everyone in-between. Really cool to see. I could only attend the earlier show (kids soccer at 7am) but I imagine the late show was just as good. Highly recommend if you get the chance!"
