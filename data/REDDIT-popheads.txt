URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1bsnlkk/which_artists_have_a_good_lower_range/ Content: We often hear about high notes and big range, but which artists are strong in the lower octaves. I’ve been listening to Beyoncé’s YA YA on repeat, and her ‘opposite falsetto’ where she goes low and channels a bit of Elvis sounds so fantastic to me. I know Taylor also has a good lower range, but I’m not sure which songs are best to hear it in. Are there any other artists or songs where the lower range is used well? Title: In the spirit of Cowboy Carter, are there any other genres different to the usual of an artist that you think they could take on? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1bsgo2z/in_the_spirit_of_cowboy_carter_are_there_any/ Content: Beyoncé has of course released Cowboy Carter this week, with a country-inspired sound also drawing on a range of different genres, and the album itself is challenging the notion of a genre itself (the ‘this isn’t a country album, this is a Beyoncé album!’ post comes to mind, plus Linda Martell’s words at the beginning of SPAGHETTII). Bey is no stranger to this, with Renaissance of course being house and Lemonade also drew on many genres, as well as The Gift being a venture into afrobeats. Many other artists throughout the years have also taken on and experimented with new genres that drift away from the genre they are known for, with some of these being more successful than others. Miley comes to mind for me, having tackled hip-hop, country and rock albums. Gaga has also taken on country and EDM for her albums, with rumors that LG7 is going to be rock. Experimenting with different genres really does feel like a distinction between artists who really care about progressing their work and those who don’t. With this in mind, are there any artists who you think could make a great body of work with experimentation of a different genre to their usual? I actually think The Weeknd could make a pretty great album with rock influences. He has already ventured from the trap-R&B sound that he started with, with the synth-pop new-wave sounds of After Hours and Dawn FM. I’d love to see what he could do with an album that incorporates rock and some blues inspiration. He did experiment with some punk-type influences on his Thursday mixtape. I know people feel like the disco trend has been a bit overdone now, but I would love to hear a disco and funk album from Ariana Grande. I feel like she would do a really good job with it, and would establish her as an artist who isn’t afraid of taking sonic risks because a lot of people do see her as sticking to the same sound. I feel like “bye” from eternal sunshine was just a flavor of what this could sound like! Might sound like a bit of an odd one, but I would love to hear Dua Lipa make a soul album with jazz and R&B influences. I feel like she has the voice for it and it could sound great.

What music artists have you been surprised to discover their age ? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1bs4gig/was_surprised_to_see_raye_is_only_26yrs_old_what/ Content: RAYEs music comes across very mature, sophisticated and stylishly clever. I would have thought she was a little older. Another I was surprised about was Megan thee Stallion. When I first discovered her, I was blown away by how mature she raps and sounds, to find she is a similar age to myself. JACOTÉNE I thought was late 20s, she’s only 17!

URL: https://tidal.com/track/353983145 Content: The credits on Cowboy Carter are finally released. It’s interesting how much backlash Beyoncé received for “ruining” Dolly’s classic Jolene. There have been plenty of think pieces about this the past few days. Turns out, Dolly wrote the new version herself 🤷🏽‍♀️. Thoughts? Title: The secrecy behind Cowboy Carter's credits URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1brp9vs/the_secrecy_behind_cowboy_carters_credits/ Content: What is going on? Ever since the album was released, there are no writer or producer credits anywhere to be found. They're missing from Tidal, Apple Music, Spotify. Her official website is missing credits for every track except for Texas Hold 'Em and 16 Carriages. And some people already have their copies of the vinyls and CDs. There are no credits printed anywhere. In fact, the pysical copies are pretty bare bones of any visual and textual content. I've never seen an artist release an album and keep their credits a secret. What is the point she's trying to make?

On one hand, it's meant that vinyl releases from the last few years have often been much less bare-bones than they have been for other modern pop records, but it's also meant that a lot of releases have been rushed and/or incomplete. Some examples of recent controversies regarding physical releases: - Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday 2 having only 8 of 22 tracks on physical media - Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter having an entirely different concept (including the title, cover, and general art direction) on physical media, including the omission of 5 tracks - Lorde's Solar Power, Charli XCX's Crash and Ariana Grande's Eternal Sunshine all including demo/unfinished versions of some songs - Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department and Olivia Rodrigo's GUTS having a different exclusive track depending on which vinyl variant was bought - Taylor Swift's Midnights CD's having a baffling array of different tracklists that makes it impossible to find a comprehensive version - Barbie The Album having different tracks omitted between releases - Björk's Fossora having completely different versions of multiple tracks, including missing features, as well as an unfinished cover art - Caroline Polachek's Desire, I Want To Turn Into You being delayed on vinyl on multiple occasions due to having a release date that was never realistic given vinyl production times I just thought it'd be interesting to have a discussion. Do you like physical media? Are you willing to sacrifice a complete or well-packaged release to ensure it's available upon release, or would you rather wait? In what ratio do you care about content (tracklists, audio quality) versus marketing (colour, collectability, packaging)? What makes you buy or not buy a piece of physical media?

Good beat! Definitely a good song!” But then when I actually listened to the lyrics, I realized it’s about him cheating on his wife. Pretty fucked up if you ask me.

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1brghgx/will_dolly_parton_give_beyoncé_50_songwriting/ Content: I really like the new version of Jolene on Beyonce’s new album, I also love the original, but it made me think about an interview that Dolly did a few years ago, where she said she had to refuse Elvis Presley’s request to record “I will always love you” since he asked for at least 50% of the credits on the song and she said no since she was the sole writer. Now that Beyoncé changed 80%+ of the lyrics of “Jolene”, do you think Dolly made an exception and gave her the songwriting credit? The credits are not visible yet. Also, if anyone has the physical album in hands where the credits would be visible, you can also enlighten us. :) Thanks!

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1bqstmi/hi_im_david_archuleta_and_my_new_single_hell/ Content: Hi! What an exciting week it's been! But for those that might've missed it, I released a new single called "Hell Together" yesterday! It was inspired by my amazing mom, known as Mama Lupe, who at first didn't approve of my lifestyle when I came out to her. I won't go into all the details (unless you want to know more, then ask away!), but long story short... I wrote this song based on what my mom told me a few days after I said I was stepping away from our church. She said “if you’re going to hell, we’re all going to hell with you.” It's dedicated to those who show unconditional love in a world where it’s so easy to judge things we don’t fully understand, the way my mom showed that to me ❤️ Now let's get to some questions, shall we? Drop your questions about Hell Together, life, your fav edm songs, or whatever it is you wanna know and I'll do my best to answer as many as I can!

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1br43o6/how_important_are_lyrics_to_your_enjoyment_of_a/ Content: And which songs/artists do you rate highly for lyricism? English isn’t my first language so I grew up listening to a lot of music before I had any clue what their lyrics were, or what they even meant. So when I listen to songs I primarily pay attention to *sound*, and lyrics don’t always matter to me. Even if the lyrics are cringey, the music can make up for it. Meanwhile my friend (English is his first language, and he’s a hip-hop head, which I think plays into how highly he values lyricism) absolutely *cannot* stand bad lyrics. It got me thinking about lyrics that are kinda awful or don’t make sense much if I spend too long thinking about them: > If teardrops could be bottled / There'd be swimming pools filled by models / Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore" — Billie Eilish, “idontwannabeyouanymore” One of my faves for lyricism is Florence + The Machine, and while the sound of a lot of her songs doesnt catch on to me (unlike Billie Eilish, where I really like her sound but have to not think too hard about her lyrics), Florence’s lyrics always strike a chord: > I drink too much coffee and I think of you often / In a city where reality has long been forgotten / Are you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified / But you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love — “Patricia” > I was never as good as I always thought I was / But I knew how to dress it up / I was never satisfied, it never let me go / Just dragged me by my hair and back on with the show — “King” Title: Lil Nas X - Light Again [demo 17] URL: https://soundcloud.com/secret-service-862007284/light-again-demo-170?ref=clipboard&p=i&c=0&si=DCD2ADC8AD5544B6BD1282112C4B4605&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing Content: No content
