URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/1bqxed5/bands_that_rock_your_local_scene_but_are_unknown/ Content: Hey lovely community! Was having this convo with a long distance friend and was super curious if you all are interested and have contributions. Are there any bands, writing and performing original music, in your local scene that either aren’t interested in growing a national audience / touring, or haven’t yet for any reason? I’m in Charlottesville, VA, and there are so many great bands that always bring folks out, put on killer shows, and have solid recorded releases. The first that come to mind are: -[Shagwüf](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4RM3Bm9KRim2R4rPSNqhFQ?si=CNtmJl-wRIKjqrKeLgxWlg) [bluesy psych punk] -[We Are Star Children](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0xClMMqNCT1IKkp63Mbb9q?si=YOW_Pj-hTxGHI8j4agHM6A) [adventure pop, indie rock] Which original bands don’t have national traction around you, but are staples in your local scene? *** Edit: oh wow, I LOVE hearing about all these scenes!! Even so many new ones I’m learning about within Virginia! (And anyone in VA should let me know if you’re interested in shows; I didn’t mention my own band because we are not playing live yet, like all these mentioned are.) I’ve added descriptors and links to the original bands I mentioned since that was becoming best practice below. So much material here to sift through! This is amazing.
