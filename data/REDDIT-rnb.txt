URL: https://i.redd.it/iukn9k8l1erc1.jpeg Content: Released July 28, 1992, What‚Äôs the 411 was the first album by singer Mary J. Blige. What‚Äôs the 411 peaked on Number 1 on US R&B charts and Number 1 on Billboard 200. The album was certified triple platinum by Recording Industry Association of America. The album‚Äôs blend of Soul singing and melodies with Boom Bap Hip-Hop production was hugely influential and laid the foundation for the Hip-Hop Soul genre. Genres: Hip-Hop Soul, New Jack Swing. I‚Äôve been wanting to do this album for awhile now but didn‚Äôt know when the right time was. But for some reason it wasn‚Äôt until this week it felt like the right time to finally cover this album. R&B was in a bit of a transitional period between 1993 and 1995. New Jack Swing was on it‚Äôs way out and R&B was branching out into other styles. One of these is the Hip-Hop Soul genre which this album helped start. The genre directly evolved from New Jack Swing and it‚Äôs kinda obvious since you can still hear a decent amount of New Jack production elements from this record. Overall when we talk about great and influential front to back albums this album will always come up in the discussion. Its influence on post-90s Contemporary R&B is still seen to this day. That said what are your thoughts on this album? Is it better than My Life? Title: Can anyone confirm this?
