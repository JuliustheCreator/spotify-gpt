Emerging trends: There are no clear emerging trends in this dataset. However, the discussion topics indicate that users are engaged in meaningful musical dialogues. 

News about artists, album releases, and tours: Beyoncé has released a new country-inspired album titled 'Cowboy Carter'. However, reactions to the album have been mixed. Users report that it seems like a departure from her previous works, lacking the depth and impact of popular albums such as 'Renaissance' and 'Lemonade'. 

Public sentiment: There seems to be a sentiment among some users that Beyoncé's recent success is more due to her established stardom than the quality of her new music. Particularly, 'Cowboy Carter' is cited as being superficially well-executed but without the soulful depth expected from her. 

Unique insights: There is a lively debate around the influence of female artists in music. Names that came up include Mariah Carey, recognized for her vocal performance and contribution to pop and hip-hop fusion, and Madonna, noted for bringing sexualization into mainstream music. Users are comparing the career trajectories and impacts of these influential women artists. Emerging trends: The community seems to be discussing how they approach music, either instinctively or analytically. This dichotomy between experiencing versus interpreting music could be interesting to bring into our recommendation system as an optional filter or preference, allowing users to explore music that suits their listening habits.

News about artists, album releases, and tours: There are no new releases or artist news in this data batch.

Public sentiment: Sentiments towards Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter' remain mixed, emphasizing the divide between a strong fandom and critique over substance and originality. There is also a general sentiment of nostalgia for times when music appealed to more universal themes instead of personal narratives. 

Unique insights: A study featured shows song lyrics becoming simpler, repetitive, and more narcissistic. Music across genres seems to express more anger and negative emotions. This could suggest a shift in the socio-cultural mood reflected in popular music. Additionally, there is an ongoing discussion about the evolution of country music, with arguments made about past artists that may not have been traditionally viewed as country (e.g., Sheryl Crow, Ryan Adams). It might be worth exploring these blurred genre lines in recommendations. 

There is a noted trend in song durations, they seem to be getting shorter, although the specific reasons for this are not provided. This might be something to consider when recommending according to song or playlist duration. first I thought hey, let's find out what did the beatles think about the ideal length of a song. I quite quickly found out that, before sgt pepper, all their songs lasted between 2-3 minutes, and after that their song durations are all over the place. Then i thought I'd look at a broader list, and decided to find out how long did the [Billboard 100 songs for each year](https://twitter.com/diegost/status/1774191119154188369) go for. In there, it's clear that up until the 80's, song durations were clearly increasing, averaging 2 and a half minutes in the early 60's and peaking at almost 4 and a half during the middle 80's. After that, popular songs started getting shorter. Way shorter. To the point where the average song duration is close to that of 1975. So I started thinking, what made people prefer shorter songs? Was it MTV? Well after the release of the first MTV video, popular songs still got a bit longer for a couple years until they stopped. So was it the relase of the CD? Well that was 1984/5 ish. Which could be an explanation, but then, the shortening never stopped. It didn't stop by the time p2p and torrents came out, and still songs being featured as the most popular are, on average, still getting shorter So I just wanted to ask all of you, what do you think drives the overall perception of how long popular songs should be? was it tech? was it a specific band or artist? Is there a limit? Title: What makes you like a specific song/composition? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bsdiua/what_makes_you_like_a_specific_songcomposition/ Content: So as the title says, please go in depth about what exactly makes music enjoyable for you. Is it just a feeling? Random and without a reason? Maybe an instrument or certain vocals? Whatever the reason may be (if it exists), do you know why it's an important factor for you? Finally, if you have multiple things in mind, which one is predominant? (more specifically, which one do you look at the most / first) Title: What If you are doing a metalcore career without a band? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bsuntl/what_if_you_are_doing_a_metalcore_career_without/ Content: Come on, it's easier to understand when it comes grunge rock because doing grunge isn't that challenging like doing metalcore and the Voice is even more important in rock music than in metal music. But doing metalcore without a band? Let's take this example, you are seeing an great instrumental from Jacob Lizotte, a metalcore one that you actually love, but you are acting as a vocalist in this case, maybe your metalcore instrumental has a great solo or a breakdown it doesn't matter you know where I want to go, metalcore is a challenging genre now let's go back to the question and adding something really really but really important: •But what if you are doing a metalcore song/career but after it, after you got a band, after you have possibilities, you are doing some great remakes with your band ? In this case my point is that this is awesome, look, you have the exclusive version and the exactly ideas for the remake, it would be a lot more easier for your band to creat your song But the opposite point appears with a question: Is this necessary doing this again? Title: What's the difference between being too generic and doing the old school style of that genre? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1brtjjr/whats_the_difference_between_being_too_generic/ Content: Let's take Melodic Metalcore for example, If a person wanna make a 2000/2010s melodic metalcore style song the next issue appears...it's too generic but if you are adding your elements and fusing your style and your fusion is good for that genre it wouldn't count as being to generic in my personal perspective...some people may think doing an old school genre is like doing a too generic song but I think it is not, if you are doing/fusing it with your personal style.. Rap Metal Exists so you can add rap in your melodic Metalcore or something totally different but I prefer to not destroy the old school atmosphere by adding too modern elements in it Title: If you don't get what Beyonce does with genre experimenting then you won't like Cowboy Carter URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bsnixp/if_you_dont_get_what_beyonce_does_with_genre/ Content: I don't think Cowboy Carter is as bad as everyone is saying it is but that is because I can truly understand what Beyonce does when it comes to blending genres. For me I became a solid Beyonce fan when Lemonade came out. I loved how she blended rock, blues, country and R & B. I continued to listen to Renaissance. Beyonce is making her own twist on country with Cowboy Carter and yes this will rile some people up. Country fans especially have very strict views on what constitutes as country music with some usually underlying racist undertones going into those perceptions of "what country really is." Most mainstream listeners also don't like country music so of course this album is dividing some fans. When listening to this album you need to understand that it is not trying to be a purely country record. It's Beyonce's version of country, rock, blues, and R & B. If you can't accept that as a concept the record won't sit well with you. I actually found it very enjoyable to listen to and love how she created a story with the interludes and storytelling is a big element of country music. Just felt like putting this out there. I'm someone who really likes it when artists play around with genres (big fan of Jewel for instance) but if you're someone whose looking for an album to fit into one genre or another this will feel like a mess. Title: [list] The legacy of British solo artists URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1brflou/list_the_legacy_of_british_solo_artists/ Content: In the past, we've had some discussions about "The Greatest American Bands", which was heavily debated. An observation was made that the UK tends to have the more iconic bands/better (Beatles, Stones, Queen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Emerging trends: A number of users are questioning why popular songs are becoming shorter. There's speculation around technology's impact, changing artist influences, and shifts in audience preferences, but no conclusive reasons have surfaced.

News about artists, album releases, and tours: Drop Nineteens are reissuing their album 'Delaware' with a change in the album's cover art. 

Public sentiment: There's an ongoing debate about artists changing their album artwork during reissues. Some fans appreciate updated imagery while others view such changes as needless tinkering that could distort the legacy of iconic albums. The appreciation for British solo artists, such as David Bowie and Elton John, is also discussed. 

Unique insights: There's an enquiry about the fine line between being too generic and sticking to an old school style of a particular genre, especially in the context of Melodic Metalcore. In another thread, users are discussing their personal factors for enjoying music, which include factors like instinct, a specific instrument, vocals, or just a feeling. Such individual preferences may be valuable for our recommender system's personalization features. Beyoncé's approach to genre-blending is discussed with divided opinion, with some users claiming those who understand her genre experimenting approach would appreciate her new album 'Cowboy Carter' better. Lastly, there are deeper discussions on the commercialization of music and how it impacts both the artists and listeners' experience. wave stuff! Their sound and style is really interesting stuff to listen to in contrast to stuff that's released nowadays. New Sensation still hits hard these days.However, I grew up in a small town, so I only heard their stuff once or twice on the radio, but I heard INXS and their song New Sensation about a billion times as part of mid-'90s car and truck commercials. Stuff like this: [1995 Toyota-thon commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_AEKO5xGI) I tried to find the specific commercial I had in mind, but it could've been a regional thing. The point is that a strong imprint was made at the time, and well, I kinda find it unfortunate that when I hear New Sensation, I associate it as part of a Toyota Sales Event. Of course, INXS has the right to commercialize their music, and I think the world benefited from that, but it makes me realize how much of a role context plays in the listening experience. As a big Aphex Twin fan, it makes me appreciate that he's tended to minimize his commercialization as his stardom has developed, for instance.I think it's interesting how direct an artist can be with their listeners nowadays, and also to consider the machinations of commercial culture and the kind of circumstances it can create in people with regards to good music that is successfully commercialized. I guess I find some valuation from bands or artists that stay away from commercializing, or are at least smart about it. But then, as the artist, if you pass up the money, it just goes to someone else, right? Perhaps this is why I am really excited by music nowadays, since I can forge that connection to the music directly. But also, I suppose it's worth considering how often people in the world get exposure to music outside of commercialized situations these days. My guess is that most music, disregarding folk music, is connected to a commercialized product nowadays. I supposed in the end, all culture is commercial, anyway, right? I guess this is where I end up--a consequence of an unfortunate commercialization of good music. Title: Can you be a performing singer without being famous? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1br8i31/can_you_be_a_performing_singer_without_being/ Content: 26F, just want to preface this by saying I’ve read the rules and even though I briefly mention mental health, I am posing this question from a place of lack of knowledge/experience about the music industry, and am NOT seeking mental health counseling. That said, I’ve loved singing since I was little and have been held back by low self-esteem and fear, but have recently decided I’d like to take a stab at putting myself out there. I’m not an instrumental musician, my voice is my instrument, so my plan as of a now is to share videos of myself singing, while making an effort to connect with other local musicians in my city, and just see where things go. If it isn’t blatantly obvious by now I don’t know much about this, but the dream would be to join a band to make music and just have some opportunities here and there to perform on stage. The caveat is I really don’t want to be famous. Now before you scoff and me and tell me not to get ahead of myself, I’m just an overthinker with anxiety who tries to predict the worst outcome. I KNOW becoming famous is EXTREMELY rare, but the scrutiny that famous music artists face is something that I know would destroy my already somewhat fragile mental health. That being said, the performing aspect *specifically* of singing, and being able to use my voice and connect with people is probably the most important to me and what I really want to do So! TLDR; my question here is, is it possible for a band to build a large enough following that said band can enjoy somewhat regular performances, while staying small/lesser-known enough to avoid the scrutiny of fame? Title: What was the last concert you went to and how was it ? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bq8huq/what_was_the_last_concert_you_went_to_and_how_was/ Content: It’s been a while since I’ve paid to go out to a concert. Just want to hear about your experiences and tastes . Maybe get some music recommendations and most importantly get inspired to get back out there and spend $$ on something I enjoy 😊 So this post doesn’t get deleted again I will repeat the question ( the prompt is very discussion friendly w/o being wordy imo) What was the last concert you went to? How was your experience at the concert? Did you hate it ? Did you have fun ? Was the act worse or better than you expected? Was there a social interaction that made the experience better/worse? Title: Sex Pistols sounds more Glam Rock than Punk to me URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bq2sa1/sex_pistols_sounds_more_glam_rock_than_punk_to_me/ Content: English is not my first language, so sorry if this turns out to be somehow confusing to read Also, i want to clarify that i'm talking about the 80s Glam Rock/Metal era. I want to start by saying that I am aware that the Sex Pistols were one of the first Punk bands, so obviously the sound of the genre evolved based on them and other groups, obviously I cannot compare their sound with bands like, for example, Minor Threat. But I can't help but compare them with other groups from the 70s such as The Misfits or The Ramones, and I honestly feel that the aforementioned sound much more like what would be the basis of Punk in the future. Meanwhile, Sex Pistols sounds to me more like something that could have perfectly come out during the Glam Rock/Metal era of the 80s, just without the refined vocals and complicated solos. I mean: it is more than obvious that Punk was an influence on most genres of the 80s such as Post-Punk, New Wave, Black Metal, Thrash Metal, and to a certain extent on NWOBH, in addition to contributing to a new sound for Hard Rock with bands like Motley Crue or Guns N' Roses, It is more than obvious that Early Crue (Too Fast For Love) and Early GNR (Before Appetite) have STRONG influences from the Sex Pistols. I consider that musically speaking the most Punk thing the Pistols have are Johnny Rotten's vocals. I would like to read all of your opinions! Title: Let's Talk: Old Town Road/Lil Nas X five years on URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bqcnxa/lets_talk_old_town_roadlil_nas_x_five_years_on/ Content: Released 2018, but first began climbing up the charts five years ago in 2019 and was threatening to score a trifecta (#1 country, pop, and R&B) that had last been done by the Everly Brothers with "Dream" in '58. Initial reviews of Old Town Road and Lil Nas X's LP were mixed iirc, but by mid-2019 X had charted in the top forty of: -Country -Dance -Adult Top 40 -Rock -Hot 100 -R&B/Hip-Hop (admittedly, these aren't all Old Town Road; F9mily was his only rock hit and Panini and Rodeo from his debut EP were also pop hits) Today here we are in 2024, after five years packed of science-fiction events, and Lil Nas X has had several other hits (including two more number ones) and more or less sits at the core of a wave of artists including Post Malone and Jack Harlow who - while rooted in hip-hop and trap - have pushed the genre beyond its traditional boundaries. If you include other trap offshoots like phonk, IMO you can say that trap is rivaling psychedelia and prog-rock as one of the most aggressively genre-defying scenes in living memory. At the same time, countrified sounds are everywhere - *Beyonce* had a number one country hit this year, and during Covid Taylor Swift revisited her roots in the folk scene. Does X deserve credit as an originator, or at least a pioneer, for any of this, and is his original 2019 run any more (or less) impressive than it was at the time? Title: tips on how to rank favorite songs URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bqwti2/tips_on_how_to_rank_favorite_songs/ Content: i am trying to make a "top xxx favorite songs of all time" playlist and i have managed to whittle it down to 150 songs. All of that was hard enough but i realise now that i haven't even gotten to the hard part yet. I still need to sort them from first place all the way through to 150th place. And all of a sudden it became almost overwhelming haha. I know this is all subjective, ranking and sorting songs. But does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to go about this the easiest, least overwhelming way? The only answer is probably to just go through each song and try to place it in between two songs, one which it is better than and one that it is worse than. But again, overwhelming. So, any ideas? Title: How do you listen to an album for the first time? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bpvst5/how_do_you_listen_to_an_album_for_the_first_time/ Content: Listening to an album for the first time When you listen to an album for the first time that has been recommended to you or tou have read good things about, how do you listen to it? Do you relax and do nothing else at the same time or read the lyrics or do you listen to it while doing other things like cleaning or driving the car? And how many chances to do you give them to grow on you? I’m curious because nowadays I find it quite difficult to listen to new albums with all the social media and stuff. I guess you know what I mean. Title: The Timeless Emotion of Colbie Caillat’s “Bubbly” – Do You Feel It Too? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bq4zsk/the_timeless_emotion_of_colbie_caillats_bubbly_do/ Content: Since 2007, when I was in my mid-20s, Colbie Caillat’s “Bubbly” has had a special place in my heart and playlist. There’s an undeniable magic in its gentle melody and soothing vocals that, to this day, brings me a sense of calm and relaxation unparalleled by almost any other song. It’s fascinating to consider how a piece of music can persistently shape our emotions and well-being over such a significant portion of our lives. I’m curious: does “Bubbly” evoke similar feelings in you? How does this song make you feel, and do you find your experience resonating with the calm and relaxation I’ve described? Additionally, I’d love to hear if there are other songs, like “Bubbly,” that have been a constant source of comfort or happiness for you over the years. What makes these tracks stand the test of time for you, and how do they continue to influence your mood and your day? Lastly, I’m interested in the elements that make “Bubbly,” or any song, enduring in its ability to touch our lives. Is it the lyrics, the melody, the memories they evoke, or perhaps something entirely different? And, on a broader scale, how has your relationship with music contributed to your emotional and mental health over time? I’m excited to share in this journey of musical reflection with you all and hopefully discover new (and old) tunes to add to our musical tastes and playlists. Title: Cowboy Carter is good... and we shouldn't be surprised URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bqsawm/cowboy_carter_is_good_and_we_shouldnt_be_surprised/ Content: Despite what some country purists or what some people in certain music forums say (who themselves look down on pop and pop artists), Cowboy Carter is a generally good album. That also shouldn't be surprising when one thinks about the amount of resources (material and otherwise) that Beyonce leverages, as well as her natural talent as an artist. Beyonce has been in the stage of her career for the last few years where she's achieved much of what she's wanted — more money than a person could spend in a lifetime, widespread critical acclaim in the popular music press, adoring fans in any major city. At this point, she can seek to make "riskier" albums, ones that show off more artistry and where every song doesn't have to have hit single potential. It is Based on the Reddit discussions, the following information could be useful for the music recommender system:

1. Length of music tracks: There has been a general trend of popular songs getting shorter. This could be attributed to a variety of cultural or technological factors such as the advent of online music streaming or changes in audience attention span. Artists such as the Beatles often kept their songs within the 2-3 minute mark early in their career, though this shifted as they evolved. This could be relevant for recommending artists with shorter song durations to listeners with limited attention span or time.

2. Particular artists being discussed: Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, and Sade are seeing a resurgence in popularity. This is likely due to factors such as their music being popularized on TikTok. Stereolab, a band known for its unique sound, is subtly rising in popularity. This topic was frequently mentioned in the comments suggesting an increased interest in these artists or their music.

3. Emerging genres: Based on discussions, genres like metalcore and Glam Rock/Metal seem to be gaining traction. Moreover, artists like Lil Nas X and Beyonce are pushing musical boundaries, with the former even creating a blend of country and hip-hop/trap music. This could be used to recommend songs from these emerging genres or artists who are known for their genre-blending music.

4. Influence of commercialization: Discourse surrounds the impact of commercialization on the appreciation of music and artists. Some believe that commercializing good music can lead to associations between songs and commercial products, which may alter the perceived value and impression of the music. This could be taken into account when recommending music to users who prefer artists that have generally avoided extensive commercialization.

5. Appreciation of songs and albums: Several users discussed how they perceive and react to different songs and albums. Factors like nostalgic ties, instrumentals, vocals, the associated culture, and the emotional impact were all frequently mentioned. This information could be used to develop more nuanced song recommendations based on these facets besides just musical genre or artist. Such as songs with strong emotional resonance or albums with deep cultural context.

6. Discussion on specific albums and songs: Albums like "Cowboy Carter" by Beyonce and "The Velvet Underground & Nico" by The Velvet Underground were discussed extensively. These insights could be used when recommending albums, by considering aspects such as genre-blending, album covers, public sentiment, and the general trend in the discussions. songs are all so intense and it’s only fun in moderation. It feels like he takes himself too seriously. I’m not sure why but I don’t feel that as much with other intense songs, like the ones by Iron and wine, or Saintseneca. Secondly, his female worship is a little too much sometimes. I’m a straight guy and although I kinda feel like that sometimes, I’m not a big fan of his descriptions of his relationships with women. It’s all very intense and very imposingly masculine in a progressive way, sure, but imagine if a female artist worships men that way in her songs. I’m sure it’ll be labeled something bad. All in all, I want to know how others think about his music. Men, tell me if you see what I’m talking about, and women, tell me what you feel listening to this man. I was talking to my friend about this and she seemed to agree that he’s not husband material but it’d be nice to be his muse for a bit. What do you think about this stance? Edit: Since most of you agree with the ‘loving in small doses’ stance, what are your other favorite artists and why would you love them in heavy doses? Also do you have any artist recommendations for something like Hozier without the intensity? The ones I can think of are Noah Kahan, Iron and Wine, Cat Stevens, and Dayglow. I’d highly recommend Dayglow since he’s not as popular and his songs are fire (Try Dear Friend, if you want those big emotions without it feeling forced) Title: artists overusing tiktok/reels on instagram? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bovt8z/artists_overusing_tiktokreels_on_instagram/ Content: I've noticed that nowadays all independent artists seem to be competing to post the most viral worthy reels and tiktoks, and its to the point where signed artists are essentially cosplaying independent artists and doing these reels with extreme budgets, forcing the actual average artist to compete with something insane and extreme as a visual standard and workflow speed. how do y'all feel about this new internet standard? do y'all think it's corny to see your favorite artist trying to self promo everyday on reels or tikok? do you think this hustle culture is sustainable when there's signed artists trying to mimic independent artists and all of this competition? Title: What are your thoughts on “tribute” bands? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bo8sgv/what_are_your_thoughts_on_tribute_bands/ Content: I’m referring to acts that cover only one band’s catalog. I’ve seen a few that cover favorites of mine, and it can be a bit odd when it’s an act that’s still alive/touring. However it can make me feel more connected to the music, especially since they often play in more intimate venues. For example, I saw a Depeche Mode cover band a few years ago called Masters and Servants. They were really on it - timing, performance, presence, all very much matching DM’s style. I had a blast. I saw DM last year at a giant arena and while they were great, I felt so far away from the band. As more and more popular acts retire/die in the coming decade, combines with our culture’s increasing reliance on nostalgia, do you think we’ll see more of these kinds of acts? Will you be inclined to spend money to see them? Title: Who decided and came up with“notes”, and the idea that if you don’t hit them you’d be out of tune? Are there any musical traditions in the world where a note we would consider “off pitch” is actually “on pitch” for them? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bofiw9/who_decided_and_came_up_withnotes_and_the_idea/ Content: Just a shower thought, really. Who decided and came up with the idea of what “correct” notes were? Is this universal? How did we collectively as a society decide that a sound vibrating at 261.6 Hz was middle C (or better still, a note, whatever you want to call it), and that if you sung or played at 263 Hz you’d be “out of tune” or “off pitch”? Are there any musical traditions out there where 263 Hz is an actual note and what we think of as a pitch perfect C4 is actually grating and “off pitch” to them? Out of curiosity, I put my vocal pitch monitor app to task for a number of different types of traditional forms of singing outside what we would commonly recognise as Western canon, such as Beijing/Chinese opera (eg https://youtu.be/wzBDB-u1pRg?si=dfCcef27_xtMD71L) and South Papuan tribal singing (eg https://youtube.com/shorts/xlTJsNlqdGk?si=b9UMy6HxajqTY1Wt) and they were all remarkably “on pitch”. Is the delineation of notes and “correct pitch” a universal concept? Title: When/why did popular artists stop being able to get away with long solos/instrumentals URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bo1lx3/whenwhy_did_popular_artists_stop_being_able_to/ Content: I feel like historically, a lot of the most popular at the time (usually classic rock) acts often featured long, meandering instrumentals/jams in their famous songs. Things like “Cowgirl in the Sand” or “Cortez the Killer” by Neil Young, or “Shine on you Crazy Diamond”, “Echoes”, etc by Pink Floyd I’m currently in a band myself, and am acutely aware of the fact that despite how much I want to play them, our audience will not sit through a 7 minute instrumental jam section like they used to. What changed? Where these songs not in fact popular at the time? Is it cause people took more drugs? Of course these acts still exist, but I feel like they’re very much out of the mainstream in comparison to today. I’d love to know everyone’s thoughts! Title: What happened to Joyce Manor? Their first album was excellent then every other album has been average at best. URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bofyuh/what_happened_to_joyce_manor_their_first_album/ Content: Hey guys, I discovered Joyce Manor through Pitchfork Media(I know they are elitist..etc.) However, I liked their first album a lot. For a punk/indie type album I thought it was great. The most of their songs were anthemic(I call out) the lyrics were angry and passionate( you'll never mend your ways) and also all the songs are catchy. To top it off both their artwork and music videos were good; a black and white aesthetic that was cool. To me they seemed like a mixture of Fugazi, Japandroids and Title Fight. Then I heard their second album I thought it was bad and made no sense. From the pink artwork to their cover of, The Buggles, "Video Killed the radio star." This feels like a comedic and nostalgic that doesn't fit their original angry aesthetic. Then the third album was also forgetable aside form one song, "Chrimas Card." They don't have neither angry anthemic songs(Tiger Jaw) nor the poppy pop-punk songs(Descendents). I tried to listen to a few songs on their album Cody but the same they sound like a "generic punk band" that has neither the melodic hardcore nor the pop tunes. I am only, "Calling then Out" since I felt that their first album had something special going on. But for some reason they aren't able to live up to their potential. Bands like Violent Soho, Tiger Jaw and Title Fight I feel are more consistant throughtout their albums. Did Producer Alex Estrada, who made the first album had a lot to do with the sound? Title: How do you reconcile the great schism in Western music? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bpayam/how_do_you_reconcile_the_great_schism_in_western/ Content: In literature, a typical 10-slot Western Canon would look like this: Odyssey, Aeneis, Divina Commedia, Hamlet, Don Quijote, Faust, War and Peace, In Search of Lost Time, Ulysses, Gravity's Rainbow There are of course lots of problems with such lists, but the main idea is that it spans several centuries and includes the most important works, including maybe 2-3 modern (20th century) entries. If we were to try to create something equivalent for music, it would look something like this: 1 des Prez/Palestrina 2 Monteverdi/Froberger 3 Bach/Handel 4 Haydn/Mozart 5 Beethoven 6 Wagner/Chopin 7 Stravinsky/Schönberg 8 Stockhausen/Cage 9 Charlie Parker/John Coltrane 10 ? number 9 may be controversial, but I'd say filling it with a jazz musician makes the most sense. So what to fill the last spot with? - another blues/jazz pioneer - a rock pioneer: Chuck Berry or Jimi Hendrix - some Hip Hop pioneer (but who?) - a folk singer like Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell - another avant-garde composer like John Cage or a minimalist like Steve Reich - other Western folk music: Celtic, flamenco, Nordic, polka, Klezmer, etc. - a funk pioneer like James Brown or a soul pioneer like Ray Charles - another electronic pioneer like Kraftwerk or Brian Eno - some hugely popular and influential artist like Elvis Presley, The Beatles or Michael Jackson - something completely different like film music, tango, metal, R&B/soul In Western music, you have this great schism from the classical tradition that started with blues/gospel/ragtime which then merged back together with some aspects of it, but still somehow stayed completely separated from compositional music. There were of course innovations that happened outside the classical tradition, in particular in jazz, rock, rap and electronic music that would be hard to ignore. On the other hand, rock, rap and electronic seem almost too trivial compared to the state-of-the-art in classical music. Rock was at the complexity level of R&B and folk music in the 60s while the classical tradition was in the wildest avant-garde phase at the time. You could argue that rock music, rap and electronic did catch up in sophistication over time, but of course only within the boundaries of trivial, popular music. So it's a sort of anachronism that happened in Western music which would make it strange to put something like The Beatles in the same list as Beethoven. What do you think? Title: Is AI music art? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bpebrm/is_ai_music_art/ Content: I love being creative. I’m just not very talented and a slow learner. I just love making things….I feel so proud of my creations even if it sucks… I love music. I always wished I had the artistic talent to create it… Now I found an AI program where I can type in my own lyrics, word for word, notate whats a verse, chorus, bridge, and etc…I assign the genre and bam, it does the heavy work for me. To me it sounds really good. It makes me smile. For the first time, being able to hear and sing along to my lyrics and feelings I had bottled up over the years, it felt life changing. However, it also felt too easy. I felt like I cheated. Yes, I wrote the lyrics, but AI did the hard work. I honestly don’t consider AI music art. My hat still goes off to actual people who make writing music their lively hoods. I honestly don’t want to see people making money off of AI music.. I like using AI to make music for my lyrics and song ideas, but again, I still don’t consider it art. What do you guys think? Are my conflicting thoughts warranted? Should I feel guilty for AI to make my lyrics into songs? Title: Guest List Concert Etiquette URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1boerxh/guest_list_concert_etiquette/ Content: Hi there, I’m unsure what the etiquette is as a relatively popular up-and-coming band (~20k insta followers) has put me on their guest list for one of their concerts. The label reached out to me and gave me the ticket (+1) as they used my artwork for promo. The only info they have is my full name and email, and they have not sent me anything other than written confirmation of me receiving a ticket. Should I ask more into it? I don’t want to look pushy or anything, since I’ve got these tickets for free. Many thanks in advance. Title: Do You *Actually* Miss The Monoculture? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bnm5sf/do_you_actually_miss_the_monoculture/ Content: The monoculture being these grand events that everyone shared or can recall, even if they weren't a fan of said thing. Think of something like the Macarena craze in the 90's; a global phenomenon that, even if you hated it at the time, you were aware of it. These type of large-scale, shared cultural moments don't really happen anymore. Chuck https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bn0iqv/what_do_you_think_of_the_song_psychobabble_by/ Content: For me it's one of her best songs, if not the best. The atmosphere, the sound design, the use of technology in accordance with the narrative. Similarly to Hide and Seek, she takes mundane, everyday sounds (in this case a phone ringing) and manipulates it to represent the theme and narrative of the song. The phone ringing, warped, manipulates the listener to feel the suffocation and intrusion the protagonist feels. The only thing that bothers me is how you can clearly hear the change of take in the vocal. You can totally notice when the take in the booth has been changed around, it definitely doesn't flow well on that aspect. It's weird because that's not something that she usually struggles with on other songs. Title: The Beatles: an incredibly influential group? Indeed, but not in the cinematic canon. URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bnv8vs/the_beatles_an_incredibly_influential_group/ Content: The Beatles might be the most influential group in all of music history, and dozens, if not hundreds, of bands can trace their sound back to them. However, they have not had the same amount of influence in other mediums. Sure, the movie A Hard Days Night was a success and is still well known today, even being placed in the Criterion Collection. But the movie is largely unknown to people outside of the world of film or The Beatles fanbase. It has not permeated the mainstream to the degree that even a subpar Marvel movie will today. In addition, none of their other movies (Help!, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be) have had any notable effect on the movie industry. It's interesting that a group could have such a lasting effect on music but not on films.  

Summary: 

1. Beyonce's new album, "Cowboy Carter," is receiving mixed reviews, with listeners praising its polished production but critiquing its lack of commitment to country music. The album's move into the genre is viewed as a response to current market trends rather than genuine exploration or passion. Public sentiment appears divided, which could impact its recommendations to individuals looking for authentic, committed country music.

2. Tribute bands are receiving a considerable amount of discussion online. Public sentiment seems to be that while there's a strange element to experiencing music from bands through the lens of another, intimate performances and an increase in retiring/dying popular acts could lead to a greater acceptance and popularity of tribute bands. These could impact recommendations for music goers looking for a live music experience.

3. There's been a debate on whether or not AI music qualifies as "art." People seem to enjoy the convenience and personalized experience it offers but still hold reservations about its authenticity compared to human-made music, impacting recommendations for individuals interested in technologically emerging trends in music.

4. The online community is discussing the overuse of TikTok/Reels by artists on Instagram. Independent musicians are feeling pressured to compete with high-budget reels from established artists. Growing discontent could impact recommendation and popularity of artists who excessively use these platforms for promotion.

5. The prominence of double meanings in songs comes under scrutiny. Participants are discussing songs with hidden connotations, highlighting how lyrical complexity and symbolic usage can change an individual's relationship with music, affecting how often such complex songs are recommended.

6. The space for personal music curation versus global pop culture , referred to as 'the monoculture,' is an emerging area of discussion. Some listeners enjoy having greater control over their taste, shaping their listening experiences versus being dictated by widely popular music. This discussion could impact recommendations systems and how they cater to an individual's personalized tastes.

For optimized recommendations, consider the prevailing public sentiment on artists, detailed feedback on recent album releases, discussions about music created by AI, reflections on double meanings in songs, and debates over personal curation and the monoculture. express your opinion, and don't worry, I won't be offended if you don't like it, I'm just curious. 

Summary:

1. Discussion is ongoing about what might be an over-indulgence in girlish male vocals within hard rock and punk genres. Lead singers such as Anthony Green, Kellin Quinn, and Brian Aubert are being brought up as key examples of this trend. This could impact music recommendations within these genres depending on listener preference towards this vocal style.

2. The question of gentrification impacting the future of music is generating a lot of debate. Speculation points to the systematic destruction of diverse and dense communities, the birthplaces of significant music genres, potentially diminishing the emergence of revolutionary music styles in the future. 

3. A post considering the haunting and powerful nature of the song "Psychobabble" by Imogen Heap is catching attention. The complex narrative and emotional depth language of the song are being considered. 

4. Criticism has been observed against the pervasive posts lamenting the quality of modern pop music. Users express that such posts lack nuanced discussion and consume space for more constructive dialogues about music.

5. Users are engaging in a discussion regarding the song "Dancing Queen" by ABBA, with assertions that it has a haunting and emotionally complex narrative that is often overlooked. This shows the interesting depth that can be found within seemingly simple pop music.

6. Online discourse is being generated around the seeming halt in the emergence of primarily European music genres following the Eurodance era. This could suggest a gap in the market for artists looking to create music with a distinctly European aesthetic. 

Current sentiment, discussions around vocal styles, cultural impacts on music, and conversations around genre evolution are all elements that could factor into the music recommendation system. Be sure to consider the public's reactions, debates, and diverse opinions when providing recommendations. be brutally honest and go in depth about why it is you do or don't listen to it, I'd love to hear all of your opinions. Title: Nickelback understanding the music business in 2001. What's your opinion on this "business aproach" to their band?. URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bmzqeb/nickelback_understanding_the_music_business_in/ Content: A small talk i found that they did in a small bar in the early days of the band (2001), in which they express their perceptions about what would come next, that business they were getting to know, etc. It's interesting how from the beginning they considered the business model very deeply and how they prepared for what was to come. Also considering that they were very young, but actes like they had known this "world" for a long time, two true businessmen. What is your opinion about this way of seeing their band? More like a job, business, than something purely artistic and for fun? Although, as they said, the love of music is one of the reasons they wanted the "business" to prosper, so they could continue making what they love. https://youtu.be/34eoIGNCZeQ?si=f1fW6enMcAjQXHBj Title: The difference between covers, remixes, and standards; How different artists in different genres use other people's music URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1bn6s5b/the_difference_between_covers_remixes_and/ Content: I've always been interested in the way genres (and their communities) work differently from one another. I want to discuss ways in which musicians in different genres use other people's music. Specifically when something is borrowed explicitly and significantly, not just being strongly influenced by something. In rock and pop music, the most prevalent usage of others' music is by doing covers. Covers can either be as identical to the original as possible or be so different that it might only share words with the original. In jazz they play standards. They'll keep the same chord progressions and melody but improvise solos. (simplifying of course) In EDM, there's remixes, where one artist will just make their own version of another song in a new style. To me, these are all basically the same idea: one artist reworking another artist's work in their own way - as close or far from the original as they care to be. The differences are interesting though. Jazz standards are more or less the origin of jazz itself. Only over time did it become more and more common to write and release your own jazz compositions. You could make a similar argument for rock, as it came from blues, but to me feels more separate from that origin. Nowadays, rock covers are mostly a novelty. EDM remixes on the other hand are essential, and there are many noteworthy artists (mostly DJs) that have nary a fully original track! How do you see things? Are there other interesting similarities/differences? -- Other examples of borrowing music: - rap music using samples, specifically not sampling other rap music - any of the many sample-based genres, like plunderphonics - traditional folk music is all "covers" in a sense - another jazz example is "quoting" one song while playing another I'm very curious to hear more examples as I'm sure there are some really cool ones out there.
