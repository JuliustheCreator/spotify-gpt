Chet Porter, an electronic music artist, recently launched his debut album “EVERYTHING YOU’VE EVER SEEN” and announced a mini U.S. tour. He describes his album as a diverse body of work that includes elements of house, trap, ambient, and indie pop music. The album is available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube. Public sentiment seems positive based on Porter's reddit AMA.

Another electronic music crew, FEMME HOUSE, a collaborative of women in electronic music, is currently active in Miami. They are involved in an Ask Me Anything discussion on Reddit, indicating an enthusiastic community engagement. 

Interest in synth music, particularly tracks with significant use of arpeggiated synth sounds, seems to be gaining attention. Preferences show for songs from Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd. Mentioned were also current artists such as Deadmau5 and modern bands that use natural reverb and tempo variations, like Blanck Mass and NIN.

A new album from Laserdance titled "Mission Hyperdrive" was released, but there is no additional discussion or public sentiment recorded.

There are discussions and requests for recommendations on where to start with electronic music, with several names being recommended such as Animal Collective, Sweet Trip, and Passion Pit.
  
Finally, there's a discussion about the Portraits GRM releases, an electronic music series with several dedicated fans contributing to the thread. Jim O'Rourke's work "Shutting Down Here" received positive feedback, as well as pieces from Lucy Railton, Kali Malone, and Eve Aboulkheir. The list suggests an increasingly diverse trend in the hard genre of dance music with a following that is engaging and interactive. Specific genres include Early Rave, Makina, Hardstyle, Happy Hardcore, Freeform Hardcore, Terrorcore, Speedcore, Extratone, Digital Hardcore, and Frenchcore. Each genre is recognized for its unique sound and beat style ranging from fast tempos and distorted basslines to combination of punk rock and hardcore dance music. These genres have dedicated artists and labels that produce their respective music.

For instance, Early Rave, one of the best things to come out of the Netherlands, is characterized by distorted 909s, rave stabs, horror movie samples, and fast tempos. Successful artists in the genre include Ruffneck and Chosen Few, and top labels include Ruffneck Records and Industrial Strength Records.

Hardstyle, which is born out of Gabber, is slower with longer, less overdriven kick drums. Artists like Technoboy, Headhunterz, and Wildstylez, and labels like Scantraxx, Dirty Workz, and Italian Hardstyle are worth noting in this genre.

Makina, a Spanish genre with communities in Japan and the UK, is a mix of trance and happy hardcore, characterized by a bouncy offbeat bass. Dj Ruboy and M-Project are popular artists with BIT music and DJ's at work known labels. 

Freeform Hardcore merges Trance and UK Hardcore with elements of Psytrance thrown in. Artists to note would be Alek Szahala, Betwixt & Between, Substanced. Labels include Nu Energy, Stamina Records, FINRG.

The music community also noted growing interest in Terrorcore, Speedcore, Extratone, Digital Hardcore, and Frenchcore with distinct artists and music styles.

Overall, the enthusiasm and engagement from the community suggest ongoing growth and interest in these genres. see producers do both Example: [Lenny Dee, Randy & The Sickest Squad - Boomshakalaka (2016 Rebuild)](https://youtu.be/O5Y2FcpzF44?si=GlYGTe3vt6Hv4pIg) Artists: The Sickest Squad, Radium, Adrenochrome, Le Bask, Hellfish, The Speed Freak, Dr. Peacock Labels: Peacock Records, Audiogenic, Frenchcore Worldwide * **Hardtek**: Associated with free parties and dudes with dreads. 190 BPM often copyright infringing goodness, has become my go to genre to spin at parties and people who've never heard it tell me how much they like it! I've never been able to really discern what separates it from “Tribecore” but that's technically another genre (Raggatek is super similar so I'll just include it in this section) Example: [Guigoo - Just 1 Love](https://youtu.be/jRzs9VIa3Ts?si=-a-98gPY2ewhgdbU) Artists: Billx, Mat Weasel, Floxytek, Guigoo (FANT4STIK) Harry Potar, C3B, T-Menace, Dr. Looney, Tanukichi, E-Coli, Vandal, Lolistyle Gabbers, Mandidextrous, MikkiM, Loctek Labels: Undergroundtekno, Narcotek, Kaotik Soundsystem, Amen4tekno, Raggatek Power, Hardtek.jp * **Breakcore**: Has seen a rise among the zoomers and Tiktok kids due to artists like Sewerslvt and Machine Girl, I'm not here to debate whether or not that's a good thing. Breakcore has it’s roots firmly in Jungle, and you can hear it in a lot of earlier iterations. Breakbeats chopped, screwed and mangled with loads of samples from any number of sources. Brutal and fast with ragga vocals, distant and moody with loads of reverb and rave sounds or goofy and dumb with pop samples and fast kick drums there's a little something for everyone here and I hope people don't stop at just Sewerslvt and Machine Girl (I like both SS and MG) Example: [Repeater - Collision Repair Specialist](https://youtu.be/4uHVSexjYCY?si=Rcxe5cLY51D8265d) Artists: Ruby My Dear, Bong-Ra, Rotator, Venetian Snares, DJ Skullvomit, Kyou1110, Ladyscraper, XÄCKSECKS, DJKurara, Squarepusher, Passenger of Shit, Epsilon, Goreshit Labels: Day of the Droids, Breakcore Gives Me Wood, Murder Channel, Super Bad Midi Breaks, PEACE OFF RECORDS, Shitwank Records, Bloodyfist Records * **Gabber**: Wait didn't we already do this one? Sort of! After OG Gabber died a new generation started, like Hardstyle this genre has gone through many different changes and is worthy of it's own thread. It's a genre I have a lot of love for and is one that would make most people's eyes go wide when I would show it to them lol. I don't like the direction Gabber has gone in recent years but I'll always have my favorite era to look back on Example: [Evil Activities - No Place To Hide](https://youtu.be/M_A9ARFw6Tg?si=mszoL0GCVSZUMhbU) Artists: Angerfist, Outblast, Art of Fighters, Neophyte, Ophidian, Andy The Core, I:Gor, Evil Activities, Unexist, Mad Dog, Stunned Guys Labels: Enzyme Records, Masters Of Hardcore, Deathchant Records, Hong Kong Violence, Dogfight Records, Industrial Strength * **J-Core**: The older I've gotten the more I dislike this name. I can't for the life of me find this article but in it I want to say DJ Sharpnel said that J-Core was used on file sharing clients and forums to classify ANY KIND of Japanese Hardcore. To me J-Core doesn't have defining sound (like Frenchcore) and it's used very loosely to the point where it's kinda useless. Which isn't to say you shouldn't check out Japanese Hardcore artists because holy shit it was life changing for me! Example: [Anglerfish Team - Enter Enter MISSION! (DJ Sharpmarker Remix)](https://youtu.be/w_UHd6Gv7UA?si=wzIeVcYP49U5le3e) Artists: REDALiCE, t+pazolite, DJ Sharpnel, Noizenico, DJ TECHNORCH, DJ Genki, DJ Myosuke, NNN, Roughsketch, Kobaryo, DJ Noriken, P*light Labels: Shaprnel Sound, 999 Recordings, HARDCORE TANO*C, Solidbox Records, C.H.S, Japanese Stream Hardcore, Sketch-up! Recordings * **Crossbreed**: A combination of Industrial Hardcore and Drum & Bass, not gonna lie I've never heard much of the DNB influence in this creature but holy shit this stuff can knock a tooth loose. Tight snares, dirty kicks and a dark atmosphere all combine to make something so fucking awesome that even the most snooty Drum & Bass head can be swayed by it’s dark powers Example: [The Outside Agency - Prepare to Die](https://youtu.be/XnnGjBPAMkw?si=mrcTO6SPOfg1FvOY) Artists: Eye-D, DJ Hidden (The Outside Agency), Igneon System, C-Netik, Hallucinator, Switch Technique, Sinister Souls, Counterstrike, Lowroller, The Satan Labels: Genosha One Seven Five, PRSPCT Recordings, Oblivion Underground Recordings, Abused Recordingz, Future Sickness Records * **Hands Up**: Remember the 2000s? Remember when Hands Up could chart and be played on mainstream radio? Ahhh good times… One of the softer forms of Hard Dance, I guess you could consider it pop music but boy do I sure love it and all it's bubble gum goodness, still going strong away from the limelight! Example: [Cascada - Everytime We Touch](https://youtu.be/4G6QDNC4jPs?si=AjtXN4aZ_upsIwGU) Artists: Danceboy, CLAWZ, Summertunez, The Italo Brothers, Rob Mayth, Aki, Smile dk, Vau Boy Lables: Hands Up Legacy (I can’t find many labels lmaooooo) * **Eurobeat**: I mean… I'm sure most people know about this one. Evolved from italio disco with it's catapult to recognition being the Anime “Initial D” I'm not 100% sure it's Hard Dance, but lots of hard dance fans I know fuck with it so I'll put it here! A hard to describe kick sound and blaring synths trying to emulate brass with some vocals by dudes with noticable European accents! What's not to love? Example: [Smile.dk - Koko Soko (AKIBA KOUBOU Eurobeat Remix)](https://youtu.be/X7kMP24N2UI?si=mB4D60xMPiG9sNsg) Artists: Oddesy (Ken Blast), A-One, Go2, Lupin, Hot Blade, Za-Za Labels: avex (specifically the Super Eurobeat comps, I’m being a little lazy here but holy fuck there are so many that it's more than you could ever ask for) * **Hard Trance**: Back when Hardstyle was new, Hard Trance and it were hard to distinguish. There are a few variations of Hard Trance but my favorite will always be Gated Kick Hard Trance. If you can imagine Hardstyle percussion mixed with Trance Melodies then you've already got a good idea of what it sounds like. Not as popular as it used to be but somehow stays alive Example: [Josh Lang - Sawtooth Highway](https://youtu.be/-Lt9JoJNHTk?si=fa-aChOOopXxjlDS) Artists: Luca Antolini, Andrea Montorsi, Splinta, Kid Kaos, Alex Kidd, Josh Lang, Log:One, Nomad, Pacific Link, Yoji Biomehanika Labels: Kiddfectious, Therabyte, K405 Records, Lashed Music, Trancefuzion Recordings, Hell’s House * **UK Hardcore**: Happy Hardcore cheese with an offbeat bass. I'm oversimplifying Recent discussions on music platforms highlight a wide range of music genres and styles. Interest in these genres seems to be driven by a desire for more eclectic and distinct sounds.

Genres like Hardtek and Breakcore are mentioned along with their influences. Hardtek, associated with free parties and noteworthy for its fast pace, is praised for its appeal even to those unfamiliar with the genre; Artists such as Billx and Floxytek, and labels like Undergroundtekno and Amen4tekno are associated with it. Breakcore, a genre deeply rooted in Jungle music, is noticed for its rising popularity among younger audiences and users on platforms like TikTok. It's characterized by scrambled breakbeats and diverse sampling, with artists like Ruby My Dear and Venetian Snares mentioned as key contributors.

Engagement with other hard sub-genres such as Schranz (a Germanic-origin genre known for galloping kicks, associated with artists like Eto & Gab), Hard House (American and UK versions distinguished for their mix of hardcore influence and bouncy rhythm, associated with artists like Tidy Boys and DJ Irene), and UK Hardcore (characterized as a cheesy variant of Happy Hardcore with an offbeat bass, associated with artists like Nu Foundation and Gammer) also indicate that there's a dedicated audience for these styles.

Meanwhile, more mainstream genres like Eurobeat and Hard Trance are also gaining attention. Eurobeat, a genre widely recognized due to the anime "Initial D", is loved for its unique kick sounds, synth layering, and distinctive vocals. Hard Trance, frequently associated with Hardstyle, is favored for its mix of Hardstyle percussion with Trance melodies. 

The growing popularity of these musical styles suggests that listeners are interested in exploring a wide range of music sub-genres that offer distinct and innovative sounds. the best shows I've seen in a while URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/1bpia8m/orbital_playing_the_green_and_brown_albums_was/ Content: I don't get out much these days and the last time I saw them was about 25 years ago. But I went out to see them in NYC last Friday and it was amazing! I haven't danced like that in years. Both of these albums were incredibly important to my growing love of electronic music in the early 90's and it was awesome to see them perform these classics live. The crowd was great to, old heads, young heads, and everyone in-between. Really cool to see. I could only attend the earlier show (kids soccer at 7am) but I imagine the late show was just as good. Highly recommend if you get the chance!

This track really stood out to me as quite different:Station to Station to Station, Act 3 by Timo Kaukolampi.[https://youtu.be/WAKQRmRC0zw](https://youtu.be/WAKQRmRC0zw) It's based round a fairly simple and minimal set of synth arpeggios - so its got that repetitive, hypnotic vibe - but it occasionally shifts the main accent of the rhythm round in ways that momentarily gets a bit wonky. I like that its a bit more rhythmically interesting and modern sounding and a bit less new age ambient or obviously Berlin school influenced than some of the other tracks I've been hearing - but it stops short of being obviously glitchy or experimental - it still has a solid groove. Please recommend me some current artists doing tracks like this based round synth arpeggios. Thanks!

It had a grey or silver cover, with (I think) two red and blue stripes on one side, vaguely diagonally. I have a feeling it was French, but it may have a just had the word “French” in the title. I also think there was a year in the title, contracted with an apostrophe, like ‘75 or ‘79. I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called. Any help would be super appreciated!

Does the Berklee scene have any spots ? Anyway, thanks 🙏
