Title: Who are some artists who derailed their entire career with one album? URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1bsig2h/who_are_some_artists_who_derailed_their_entire/ Content: I’ll tread lightly here because this guy is a hip-hop legend and one of my favorite MC’s…but…in my opinion, Raekwon derailed his career with his sophomore album “Immobilarity”. We’re talking the follow-up to OB4CL and this album had no rza, no Ghostface, it was just a commercial disappointment. In comparison, Ghost was album to continue his career going with “Supreme Clientele”, whereas Raekwon has always been in the shadow of OB4CL. Can make a case here for GZA too since it’s a similar situation.

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1bspydv/discussion_ugk_ugk_4_life_15_years_later/ Content: Fifteen ago the final UGK album was released, almost a year and a half after Pimp C's unexpected death. Aside from a bittersweet reference done by Sleepy Brown and a "RIP" shoutout at the end of a long overdue guest verse of Snoop Dogg, you can't even tell Pimp was gone. The album literally opens with him saying "back from the dead", so his presence is felt throughout the whole thing. He never left. The work was complete, some songs were almost included in the previous double-album (Underground Kingz) and the production made mostly by one of his protegés, Steve Below, with Cory Mo and Averexx, makes this hour long album the epitome of country rap tunes. There isn't a song I skip. There's not a line I don't like. I can sing the whole thing, I memorized the intro and the outro. To me this is just perfect, and there's not much else I can say to praise it. **Long live the Pimp!** Tracklist: 1. Intro 2. Still on the Grind (feat. Raheem DeVaughn) 3. Everybody Wanna Ball 4. Feelin' You 5. The Pimp & The Bun (feat. Ron Isley) 6. She Luv It 7. 7th Street Interlude 8. Swishas & Erb (feat. Sleepy Brown) 9. Purse Come First (feat. Big Gipp) 10. Harry Asshole (feat. Lil' Boosie & Webbie) 11. Used to Be (feat. 8Ball & MJG, B-Legit & E-40) 12. Steal Your Mind (feat. Too $hort & Snoop Dogg) 13. Texas Ave. Interlude 14. Hard as Hell (feat. Akon) 15. Da Game Been Good to Me 16. Outro Title: El-P - Habeas Corpses (Draconian Love) (feat.

Title: Kendrick Lamar was supposed to headline the biggest Music Festival in Mexico last night and he was a no-show. URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1brwb5w/kendrick_lamar_was_supposed_to_headline_the/ Content: Last night at the [Pal Norte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pal_Norte) festival in Monterrey, Mexico, there was a big letdown for fans as Kendrick Lamar didn't show up for his scheduled performance. Just to give you some background, Pal Norte is one of Mexico's major music festivals, right up there with Vive Latino. Vive Latino takes place in CDMX, while Pal Norte draws huge crowds to Monterrey. This disappointment came hot on the heels of Kendrick's [amazing show at the Ceremonia Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d3rCPVrz8w) in CDMX last week. At the end of that show, he even mentioned he'd be back for Pal Norte, which got fans super excited. The trouble started when Kendrick was supposed to go on stage at 11:30 pm. About an hour before that, while another artist, Peso Pluma, was performing, the festival's Facebook page announced that due to ["Logistic Issues](https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/gossip/kendrick-lamar-cancela-su-presentacion-en-tecate-pal-norte-una-hora-antes-de-salir-11678667.html), Kendrick wouldn't be performing. Instead, they extended Peso Pluma's set by an hour. Fans were understandably upset, with many of them buying tickets specifically to see Kendrick. What's even more frustrating is that neither Kendrick nor his team has explained what happened. People in Mexico have been voicing their disappointment on social media, although Kendrick's [social accounts](https://www.instagram.com/kendricklamar/?hl=en) don't seem very active. There's a lot of speculation going around, like whether Kendrick even made it to Monterrey or if there were issues with the festival organizers paying him. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last year, Korn canceled a show in Mexico, and the year before that, it was Blink 182. It's making some fans wonder if American artists announcing shows in Mexico and then canceling last minute is becoming a trend.

What did y’all make of the first listen? I personally liked it a lot. I’ve enjoyed both Renaissance albums so far. I loved the Blackbird and Jolene cover too. The Miley and Post Malone features are fun too, nothing special tho. Really loved both Shaboozey features and I’ll deffo deep dive into their discography even more. DAUGHTERS, SPAGHETTI, TYRANT and SWEET HONEY BUCKIIN’ were my instant favorites. Her vocals are some of the best on this record. The vocals on DAUGHTERS alone send me into tears at every listen. Can’t wait to see what Easter eggs and references people will dig up that are still hidden. I think this trilogy will be her magnum opus when it’s all done. She’s really outdone herself so far.

Mickey & Ral Duke returns with their next venture in the series and it has been named “Super Shredder”. I’m thinking it can be tough to make a follow-up to a classic, but Mickey & Ral did it and if you ask me, they overdid it. I can honestly say this is my favourite album from Mick’s catalogue, it’s his most cohessive and most conceptual to date and we know you’re all going to love it.
