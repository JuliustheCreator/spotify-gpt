# Spotify Music Recommendation Website ðŸŽµ

## Overview
A Flask application that generates music recommendations based on user inputs using OpenAI APIs. This project is under development, with future plans to integrate the Spotify API for playlist creation and standard user data analysis and visualization.

### Current Features
- Music Recommendations: Input songs/artists to get suggestions.
- Flask Backend: Handles interactions with OpenAI's API and will integrate with the Spotify API.
- Basic Frontend: Utilizes HTML and JavaScript.

### Future Development
- Spotify API Integration: To enable automatic playlist creation 
- User Data Analysis & Visualization: To offer data-driven insights, would rather not work too much on the frontend though

## Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App Locally

  ```bash
  flask run
  # or
  python -m flask run

  # Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
  ```
